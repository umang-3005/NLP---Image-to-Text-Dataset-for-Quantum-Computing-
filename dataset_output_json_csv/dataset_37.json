      "where the CNOT circuits Ck are chosen such that the first n rows of A are given by C⌈m/n⌉· · · C1, the second n rows by C⌈m/n⌉· · · C2, and so on, see Fig. 1 for an example. If the rank condition above is not satisfied, decompose A into the minimal number ℓof sub- matrices with full rank, and proceed as above. The smallest meaningful example of such states—with n random, linearly independent terms—can thus be prepared using a single layer of rotations and a CNOT circuit. By the fact that GL(n, Z2) is a group, uniformly random architecture matrices Ci and phases θi generate a uniformly random HPS. This protocol for the implementation of HPS is also interesting from an early fault- tolerance perspective, since there are quantum codes in which all required operations are transversal, yielding a highly efficient fault-tolerant implementation. To see this, con- sider a q = 2d-fold discretization of the unit circle. Now, we observe that there are d-dimensional CSS codes with a transversal Z1/2d−1 gate such as the [[2d −1, 1, 3]] sim- plex code [ZCCC07]. By the fact that they are CSS codes, they also admit a transversal CNOT gate between code blocks. This means that HPS can be prepared using transver- sal in-block Z1/2d−1 gates as well as inter-block CNOT gates, making them amenable to implementations in early fault-tolerant architectures such as reconfigurable atom arrays [BEG+24], or trapped ion processors [RBB+24, RAC+24] in which arbitrary inter-block connectivities can be achieved.",

      "model described by Eq. (10). The model we experimentally implemented is, in fact, more general than that given by Eq. (10), as we constructed a three-qubit model, which is then reduced to three different single-qubit models. Specifically, by measuring one of the three qubits and tracing out the other two, we could derive the previously studied model, along with two additional models that have not been examined before. Figure 2 illustrates the real parts of all the eigenvalues of the Liouvillians that describe the dynamics of the three single-qubit dissipative models based on our simulated experiments using the three-qubit circuit shown in Fig. 1(a). Furthermore, we conducted experiments on this circuit, measuring the third qubit to obtain the eigenvalues displayed in Fig. 3(a) and the second qubit for those in Fig. 3(b). These figures present our experimental results alongside their simulations from Fig. 2 for both models. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we hereafter focus on the specific cases illustrated in Figs. 2(a), 3(a), and 4, which correspond to the model given by Eq. (10). In our experiments the system ˆ ρin ≡ˆ ρ(t) was prepared in one of the six input states, which are the eigenstates of the three Pauli operators. Then, the evolution under a given map was applied. Finally, we measure ˆ ρout ≡ˆ ρ(t + dt) in the x, y, and z bases to reconstruct L (and, consequently, L). The results of the experiments, conducted on an IBMQ processor (i.e., Nairobi) [84], were plotted in Figs. 3 and 4. The measurements were performed for 30 points with 20,000 shots per experiment, and the evolution step was ωdt = 1/15. Quantum processors are error-sensitive due to their susceptibility to noise and decoherence. To mitigate errors, we used dynamic decoupling. This involves applying a sequence of pulses to each qubit to protect it from ambient noise. The idea behind the method is to repeatedly apply a series of the inversion or refocussing pulses that reverse the effect of noise. These pulses effectively separate the qubit from its environment and can increase the qubit coherence time. This method is conceptually similar to the spin-echo method. Specific examples of our reconstructed Liouvillians including their experimental errors are presented in figures 2-4 in comparison to our theoretical predictions. Examples of the coupling map and calibration data for the used quantum processor are shown in Fig. 5. Our experiments were implemented on a seven-qubit IBMQ processor (Nairobi) [84] and we used the Qiskit Runtime environment, which provides a controllable error mitigation and suppression to perform our experiment. Note that, we also performed experiments on several other quantum processors (including the Oslo processor) from IBM, which we selected based on their coupling maps. However, the Nairobi processor resulted in the best results compared to our theoretical predictions and the lowest experimental errors. Specifically, the theoretical and reconstructed process matrices S, at the first LEP in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), are shown in Fig. 6 obtained for a single-qubit circuit. Analogously, Fig. 7 shows S obtained for the two-qubit circuit [depicted in Fig. 1(b)] for the first LEP in Figs. 4(d) and 1(e). Moreover, in Figs. 4(c) and 4(f), we show the scalar products (overlaps) Oexp 12 = |⟨˜ σexp 1 |˜ ρexp 2 ⟩| between the experimental left and right eigenmatrices,",
      "measurements. A multi-qubit (say n-qubit) QPT can be realized by replicating (n times) a given experimental setup for a single-qubit QPT [74]. This implies that the dimension of a reconstructed Liouvillian superoperator and the complexity of QPT grows exponentially with n. Recent experimental implementations of QPT (and related tomography methods) include: trapped-ion qubit gates [78], superconducting quantum processors [79, 80, 81], photon polarization damping channels [82], and plasmonic metamaterials operating as polarization-dependent loss channels in quantum plasmonics [83], etc. However, to our knowledge, the experimental observation of LEPs of the Liouvillians reconstructed via QPT has not been reported yet. We analyze and experimentally implement QPT and reveal LEPs using single-, two-, and three-qubit superconducting circuits, shown in Fig. 1, using an IBM quantum (IBMQ) processor [84]. Note that we initially performed simulations on the circuits, both without and with noise, as shown in Figs. 2–4. Only afterward we conducted the actual experiments. Therefore, our main experimental results are presented alongside the simulation results in Figs. 3 and 4. We argue that various experimental methods used for single-qubit QST [20] and QPT (e.g., [80, 85]) can be modified to induce and reveal LEPs along the lines described here. QPT can enable experimental finding not only LEPs but also quantum diabolical points, which can reveal dissipative phase transitions and a Liouvillian spectral collapse [60, 61]. We note that QST has been applied across LEPs in Refs. [21, 22] (see also Ref. [20]). But to our knowledge QPT has not been applied to reveal LEPs yet. In particular, an LEP-based quantum heat engine was studied experimentally in Refs. [48, 49], but neither QST nor QPT was applied there. Our work serves primarily as a proof-of-principle study, demonstrating the experimental feasibility and effectiveness of QPT for analyzing quantum system dynamics near LEPs. Another key feature of our paper is that it is the first experimental observation of an LEP in a system that does not exhibit any HEPs, as highlighted in the article’s title, including single-, two-, and three-qubit systems. In our view, this result would hold significant value on its own, even if it had been obtained without the QPT-based approach described here, but rather through established methods used in prior LEP-related experiments. Additionally, we report notable physical phenomena, specifically the direct observation of transitions between non-spiraling and spiraling regimes. These regimes, associated with distinct decay behaviors governed by real and complex Liouvillian eigenvalues, were observed in physical systems (including single-, two-, and three-qubit systems), where LEPs had not previously been experimentally observed. Previous experimental studies were limited to single three-level systems (qutrits). The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we recall the LEP formalism and describe how to detect LEPs via QPT. In Sec. III, we show the applicability of the method by analyzing a specific prototype model of a lossy driven qubit exhibiting LEPs but not HEPs. By applying completely positive maps with unitary gates, as described in Sec. IV, we implemented the model on IBMQ processors, as reported in Sec. V. The",
      "Here we provide estimates for the total measurement times for the different circuits. 1. For the experiments using the single-qubit circuit: The number of experiments per data point was 72, the number of shots per experiment was 20,000, and the time per shot was 5.7 × 10−6 s. Thus, total number of shots was Ntotal = 72 experiments × 20, 000 shots = 1, 440, 000 shots and the total measurement time was ttotal = 1, 440, 000 shots × 5.7 × 10−6 s ≈8.208 s. 2. For the experiments using the two-qubit circuit [shown in Fig. 1(b)]: The number of experiments per data point was 36, the number of shots per experiment was 20,000, and the time per shot was 6.5 × 10−6s. Thus, the total number of shots was Ntotal = 36 experiments× 20, 000 shots = 720, 000 shots and the total measurement time was ttotal = 720, 000 shots × 6.5 × 10−6 s ≈4.68 s 3. For the experiments using the three-qubit circuit [shown in Fig. 1(a)]: the number of experiments per data point was 18 and we performed 20,000 shots per experiment with the time per shot about 8.9 × 10−6s. Thus, the total number of shots is given by Ntotal = 18 experiments × 20, 000 shots = 360, 000 shots, and the total measurement time was ttotal = 360, 000 shots × 8.9 × 10−6 s ≈3.204 s In summary, the estimated total measurement times are approximately: 8.21s, 4.68s, and 3.20s for our experiments using the single-, two-, and three-qubit circuits, respectively. The same information can be expressed in the required numbers of the quantum processor cycles. Here, we denote a single quantum processor cycle as τ, instead of",

      "Herein, the circuit depth scales linearly as the qubit num- ber n and hence can serve as an efficient amplitude- encoded state preparation subroutine for many QML and quantum-enhanced Monte-Carlo integration tasks [25, 39–41]. The circuit depth also depends linearly on the free parameter numbers M and the maximum constraint order df, which are usually a small constant, as detailed in SM [37]. The logarithmic dependency on the precision 1/ϵ comes from the imperfect rotation angles. The suc- cess probability dependency on the filling rate [19, 22], which is to characterize the amplitude-encoded prepara- tion complexity of continuous function, is equal to the optimal analytic result up to known. We build MEDL in the explicit quantum circuit and show output states in Fig. 2(b-e). Here, we demonstrate exponential, Chi-squared, normal, and Rayleigh distribu- tions with applications in financial time series, statistics, machine learning, and physics, respectively. For each distribution family, several distribution parameters are tested. All experiments match well with their theoretical results, representing the generality of the MEDL. A key feature of MEDL is that the varying model pa- rameters ⃗ λ are encoded explicitly into the rotation an- gles ⃗ θ in parameterized layers while the constraint layers and exponentiation layers remain invariant. This pro- vides two main advantages. First, the circuit structure is static, enabling advanced circuit compilation, deep op- timization, reuse, and high-precision computation of the phase factor, which is considered a primary error source in QSVT [22, 30]. Second, most layers in the circuit re- main static for preparing distributions of the same fam- ily, allowing an efficient scheme for preparing a mixture of distributions.

This should not be surprising since, at least intuitively, the largest filling rate is achieved and that is coincident with former works [S5, S6]. (c) There is a one-to-one correspondence between the rotation angles ⃗ θ and the re-normalized coefficients 2λk∥fk∥max : 1 ≤k ≤M. Thus it can be viewed as a parameterized layer wherein a quantum optimization method such as parameter shift rule can be applied. (d) Herein, each Lagrange multiplier λk is encoded explicitly as a rotation angle θk in the ULCC subroutine (see Figure 2(b)). One noticed that while for common distributions these Lagrange multipliers can be computed from model parameters directly, indeed they can also be learned from some unknown distribution or observed data. As a result, this SI-PQC can be treated as not only a random variable generator but also a problem-inspired ansatz for quantum optimization algorithms.",

It should be emphasized that for standard elementary functions such as constant, power, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithms functions, the corresponding subroutine can be viewed as a static- structured subcircuit (depicted in the blue boxes in Fig. 2 (b)). Furthermore, any in-depth circuit simplification or compilation can be introduced and cured to improve the practical execution performance.

This illustrates the better interpretability beyond other variational-based learning protocols. The experi- mental results agree very well with the target distribu- tion, characterized by the K-L divergence and fidelity relative to the target distribution, depicted in Fig. 4(d). Note that the training protocol of SI-PQC is not limited to any specific distribution, where we show the training of exponential mixture model in SM [37]. The potential quantum advantage is twofold: Firstly, suppose that one is given access to quantum data, such as the intermediate state from another quantum algo- rithm that needs further statistical characterization or evaluation. Instead of a costly quantum state tomogra- phy procedure, SI-PQC-based model calibration can save the consumption of quantum states and time.

      "LSTM networks [2] are a specialized form of RNNs [1], particularly adept at capturing extended sequential dependen- cies in data. When applied to Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tasks [35]–[37], the LSTM model processes each word in a sentence sequentially, leveraging its memory cells to retain contextual information. This approach allows it to assign the correct POS tag to each word by considering both past and future context within the sequence. Unlike traditional methods such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [38] and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) [39], LSTM networks can capture long-range dependencies due to their unique gating mechanisms. This capability enhances their understanding of syntactic patterns in complex sentences, establishing LSTM as a powerful tool for NLP tasks, includ- ing POS tagging.

As illustrated in Fig. 2, the fundamental unit of the proposed QK-LSTM architecture is the QK-LSTM cell. Each QK- LSTM cell modifies the standard LSTM cell by replacing the linear transformations with quantum kernel evaluations, effectively embedding the input data into a high-dimensional quantum feature space. 1) Classical LSTM: The standard LSTM cell comprises three gates—the forget gate ft, the input gate it, and the output gate ot—and the cell state Ct.

Therefore, we first construct the quantum circuit for Uinv0 : |p⟩|0⟩|0⟩→|p⟩|p−1⟩|0⟩that implements the multiplicative inverse (Ma)−1 in F((24)2), and the quantum circuit for c1 is introduced subsequently. Any element in F((24)2) can be denoted as p = p0 + p1x, where p0, p1 ∈F(24). The multiplicative inverse of p in F((24)2), denoted as p−1, is represented as p−1 = n0 + n1x for distinction. The value of p−1 can be determined through a four-part process involving (p17)−1(p0 + p1), (p17)−1p1x, p12×λ, and (p0+p1)p0. Therefore, by combining the quantum circuits of F(24)inv0 (see Section III-B), Mul0 (see Figure 9), Mul1 (see Figure 10), and Uq2×λ (see Figure 8), the quantum circuit U 1 inv0 : |p⟩|0⟩|0⟩→|p⟩|p−1⟩|0⟩for computing the multiplicative inversion in F((24)2) can be constructed as shown in Figure 13.

      "the Toffoli gates into combinations of T gates and Clifford gates is summarized in Table VII. 2) The quantum circuit for c2 : |a⟩|b⟩|0⟩→|a⟩|b ⊕ S(a)⟩|0⟩: When the target qubit is |b⟩instead of |0⟩, the given quantum circuit can be denoted as c2 : |a⟩|b⟩|0⟩→ |a⟩|b ⊕S(a)⟩|0⟩.

      "on Algorithms 1 and 2, each round of key expansion pro- cess contains RotWord, SubBytes, Rcon and XOR four operations. The RotWord can be implemented by simply rearranging the output order of the qubits, without requiring any quantum operation. The Rcon is a constant (see Section II-A2) and can be efficiently implemented with at most four NOT gates for AES-128, at most five NOT gates for AES- 192, while at most one NOT gate for AES-256 in each round of the key expansion process. The XOR operation between two 32-bit words during key expansion can be implemented with 32 CNOT gates. Since each round of the key expansion process operates on 128 qubits, only the relevant subset of the full structure of the key expansion process (see Figure 25) is needed, with other operations being neglected. Let KEl j represents the operation from |kj⟩i−1 to |kl⟩i−1 in KE : |k⟩i−1|0⟩→|k⟩i|0⟩, while ignoring other parts, where 0 ≤j ≤l.

      "of inter-core operations, it is essential to efficiently allocate logical qubits across the physical qubits of the given cores. While the literature in this emerging domain is limited, some approaches have concentrated on quantum compilation and mapping for modular quantum computing [60–63]. In these approaches, the quantum circuit is divided into smaller partitions, and interaction graphs reflecting operations within a circuit segment are mapped onto cores by grouping qubits with high interaction levels (see Fig. 1). All previously stated strategies within both single- and multi-core quantum computation share a common goal: tailoring quantum circuits to device-specific attributes and constraints, while minimizing the communication overhead. However, they often only focus on a limited set of circuit features, such as gate and qubit counts, and qubit interactions. What is missing is a more comprehensive quantum circuit characterization that goes into deeper aspects. For example, one can explore the characteristics of the qubit interaction graph, such as the frequency of interactions between qubit pairs [18] and the distribution of these interactions among qubits, as well as the quantum instruction dependency graph (representing gate dependencies for scheduling). Some researchers have already highlighted the significance of incorporating application-specific properties [13, 15–18,37] to enhance quantum circuit mapping and overall quantum system performance. Even in classical computing, the allocation of computing resources depends on the intended applications and processes. In a similar vein, thorough profiling aids in identifying the essential circuit features for successful execution on a particular device and vice versa. Yet, as we explore the intricacies of running algorithms on modular architectures, it becomes evident that this realm demands a distinct approach when compared to conventional monolithic NISQ devices.",

      "Quantum circuits so far have mostly been characterized in terms of size, i.e., the number of qubits, gates, two-qubit gates, and depth, which are blind to the circuit’s structure. Considering that the main quantum hardware constraints are low fidelity and limited qubit connectivity, it is important to extract more information about the qubit interaction distribution as well as gate dependencies as they directly relate to gate and depth overhead that results from the compilation process. Previous works have emphasized the significance of deriving additional circuit parameters based on qubit interaction and quantum instruction dependency graphs for the development of mapping techniques [12, 32, 33, 62]. While gate dependency graphs have been utilized for operation scheduling optimization and look-ahead techniques, interaction graphs have typically been employed for the initial qubit placement and routing procedure. In this work, we utilize these two graphs and their graph-theory-based attributes for characterizing circuits targeting both single- and multi-core architectures. In the next paragraphs, we will introduce these two graph representations of the quantum circuit. The Interaction Graph (IG) Gi(Vi, Ei) offers a visual representation of the spatial distribution of two-qubit gates for a given quantum circuit. Typically, this is an undirected and connected graph (see Fig. 2(b)), with edges denoted as e(vi, vj) ∈ Ei representing the two-qubit gates and nodes labeled as vi ∈Vi representing the qubits engaged in these gates [18, 62]. Previous research [18] has demonstrated that different categories of circuits (e.g., real algorithms and random circuits) exhibit varying compilation performance in terms of gate and depth overhead as well as fidelity decrease when executed on different physical-qubit topologies (see Figs. 5 and 14 of [18]). To understand the underlying reasons for these differences, prior studies have explored the structural disparities between various quantum circuit groups based on their interaction graphs. The quantum circuit mapping problem can be conceptualized as a graph problem, in which the comparison between the interaction graphs of a circuit and the coupling graph of the device is crucial [54]. Therefore, the parameters of the interaction graph can significantly influence the outcome. Studies such as [18,24] have illustrated how the interaction graph and size parameters of quantum circuits directly correlate to their performance on different chips when employing the same mapping technique.",
      "For example, circuits with fully connected interaction graphs are expected to incur higher overhead, unless the processor’s coupling graph is fully or almost fully connected. Moreover, research such as [18] has further clustered the circuits based on these extracted parameters and identified performance discrepancies among the groups based on the aforementioned mapping metrics. Interaction graphs play an even more significant role in the compilation of circuits for multi-core systems [64]. Mapping to multi-core devices involves minimizing inter- core communication by partitioning the interaction graphs and effectively allocating the logical qubits (IG nodes) onto the physical qubits of different cores. This is achieved by aiming to map highly interacting qubits (with high IG weights) onto the same core. Given the importance of IG partitioning in modular compilation and its distinct approach compared to single-core systems, it is essential to use different IG metrics. These metrics should focus on identifying local clusters and cliques to effectively describe how ’partitionable’ a circuit is. Besides that, the Gate-Dependency Graph (GDG) Ggd(VGD, EGD) is a directed and connected graph illustrating the interrelations between the gates in the circuit. Each gate in the circuit is represented by a node vj ∈VGD, and the dependency between gates is depicted as a directed edge e(vj, vk) ∈EGD. An illustrative example of this concept is shown in Fig. 2, where a quantum circuit consisting of 6 qubits and 8 two-qubit gates is displayed alongside its corresponding IG and GDG [43]. It is worth noting that both graphs can also be represented as weighted graphs: the IG becomes weighted when multiple two-qubit operations occur between the same pairs of qubits, while the GDG becomes weighted when considering, for instance, gate duration (i.e. time). For the purpose of this paper, we focus on the simplified, unweighted version of GDG, where all gates take one time step.",

Therefore, we hope that our Theorem 5.4 extending the pseudo-density matrix formalism to arbitrary dimensions, together with its simple expression through the usage of quantum states over time, may expand our understanding of spatiotemporal correlations for quantum systems beyond multiqubit systems. Before concluding, we brieﬂy propose quantum circuit implementations for measuring the two-time expectation values for qutrits in Figure 1. In this ﬁgure, we follow the convention used in Qiskit [41], in that quantum circuits are read from left to right in time and from bottom to top using the tensor product. In all drawings, the top (thick) solid wire is a qutrit, the bottom (thin) solid wire is a qubit, and double-wires are classical registers. The different gates appearing in Figure 1 can be obtained from elementary qutrit gates [10, 25, 45, 50, 61, 75, 79]. For a single measurement of Ljk, one could use a single qutrit system and one classical register to record the output, or one could use a single qutrit system, an ancillary qubit, and a classical register, where the measurement is performed on the ancillary qubit instead, since the measurement is, after all, ±1-valued. In the circuits in Figure 1, the latter has been used. An immediate question arises based on our study of the qutrit system. Namely, for arbi- trary dimension, does there always exist an orthonormal basis of light-touch observables? This",

      "When the experimenter is allowed to invoke the processing device 𝑛times, the most general strategy for channel exclusion is a so-called adaptive strategy, represented by a quantum comb with 𝑛empty slots [65–67].6 Specifically, such a strategy consists of (i) preparing a bipartite state, (ii) passing one system of the state through the device in each of the 𝑛invocations with ancillary global processing between invocations, and (iii) measuring the state after the final invocation and submitting the outcome (see Figure 1 for an illustration). The strategy is adaptive in the sense that the input of each invocation is allowed to depend on the outputs of all previous invocations. When such dependence between invocations is absent, we say that the strategy is a parallel strategy.

      "tomography with an O(r4) cost, the shadow ansatz is advantageous in the number of measurements, and, even more importantly, since the ansatz directly utilizes the measurement outcomes, the improvement over conven- tional tomography is also manifested in the circuit depth. Results—We use the CQE with the shadow ansatz to perform calculations on the linear molecule H3 with equally spaced bond lengths on a noiseless six-qubit stat- evector simulator and the noisy 127-qubit IBM Cleveland device [104, 105]. We compute the spin sector ⟨ˆ Sz⟩= 1 for H3 with the Slater-type Gaussian orbital (STO-3G) basis set [106]. Electron integrals and FCI are computed with PySCF [107]. For the noiseless simulator, we use the Jordan-Wigner mapping [108, 109] to map the six spin- orbitals to six qubits. For IBM Cleveland, additional tapering techniques are used to map the Hamiltonian to three qubits. More details on the implementation can be found in the Supplemental Material (SM). Figure 2 (a) illustrates the convergence of the CQE ground-state energy of H3 to the FCI [110] wave func- tion solution, as a function of the number M of shadows per iteration, on a noiseless simulator. The initial trial wave function is the normalized and unweighted sum of all possible spin-adapted Slater determinants to minimize the potential effect of the initial guess. All calculations show exact convergence to the FCI solution, even with the imposed randomized measurement. This shows that the shadow ACSE ansatz with as few as five shadows (M = 5) may be sufficient to converge rapidly to the FCI solution. The more shadows employed, the fewer itera- tions are needed for the convergence, which can be viewed as the shadow residual approaching the exact residual limit. In Fig. 2 (b), we further compare the circuit depth of the shadow ansatz with different numbers M of shad- ows per iteration. The circuit depth is represented by the number of elementary Pauli exponential terms af- ter first-order Trotterization. For a number of shadows fewer than 40, as more shadows are employed, the num- ber of iterations decreases but the circuit depth remains approximately constant, suggesting a trade-off between the number of iterations and the number M of shadows per iteration. We also observe that once the number",

The thin grey shadow beneath the coloured lines represents ensembles of estimations, each using NM=222 = 4194304 measurement shots to indicate the stochastic noise.

A representative example is shown in Fig. 17(left). We also find that the ansatz becomes harder to optimise in the presence of stochastic measurement errors when using ˆ M2(β) compared to ˆ M1(β)—see Fig. 17(right). In Sec. II D, we demonstrate that the ansatz wavefunction generated by ˆ M2(β) is a superposition with support on more computational basis vectors than generated by ˆ M1(β). The increased support generated by ˆ M2(β) suggests that as β is varied, the total variation in any given occupation will be less sensitive to β. Thus, we conjecture, this reduces the gradients with respect to β and makes the optimisation harder in the presence of stochastic measurement errors.

A GHZ state preparation circuit with a ladder structure of CNOT gates, shown in Fig. 1(a), turns the single-qubit Z0 opera- tor into a global X⊗n operator. Hence, this +1 stabilizer is subject to measurement errors from all qubits, while only being affected by state-preparation errors from the first qubit. This makes the observable O = X⊗n max- imally sensitive to the separation of SPAM errors. We would thus like to study the circuit of Fig. 1(a). However, to account for gate noise we would need to learn the noise of the n −1 distinct layers of CNOT gates [16, 17]. To reduce this overhead we convert the circuit in Fig. 1(a) to a similar circuit built from only two distinct layers of CNOT gates, see Fig. 1(b), which features the same behavior for the X⊗n observable. We mitigate the circuit in Fig. 1(b) with TREX [22] by first measuring the raw expectation value ⟨O⟩raw. All two-qubit gates are Pauli twirled so that the effective CNOT noise is a Pauli noise channel. We repeat this for 16n2 twirling configurations and collect 128 shots per configuration. Next, we correct SPAM errors in ⟨O⟩raw with TREX by normalizing it by a correction factor ⟨Z⋆⟩. This factor is found by measuring Z⊗n on the all-zero initial state, with measurements twirled with X gates and an assumed ideal prepared state. Under ideal state preparation the TREX correction factor is ⟨Z⋆⟩= Qn−1 i=0 fm,i, where fm,i denotes the final measurement fidelity and subscript i denotes the corresponding qubit. However, in the presence of state-preparation errors the measured TREX mitigator becomes ⟨Z⋆⟩= Qn−1 i=0 fsp,ifm,i, where fsp,i are the state- preparation fidelities. Normalizing ⟨O⟩raw by ⟨Z⋆⟩can thus cause TREX to overcompensate when the set of qubits whose state-preparation errors affect the observable (in our case only qubit 0) differs from the support of the observable (in our case all qubits), see, for example, Refs. [13, 32]. Here, we measure ⟨Z⋆⟩after a passive reset into the thermal state with 5000 shots per each of the 16 random- izations. We observe that TREX indeed over-corrects the expectation value ⟨X⊗n⟩which we attribute to the factor Q",
      "The shaded area in Fig. 1 represents the range of pos- sible values for the observable when only CNOT noise is present, i.e., the raw observable after removing SPAM er- rors and assuming no out-of-model errors. To obtain this shaded area, first, we twirl the two-qubit gates and learn a sparse Pauli-Lindblad noise model for the two layers L1 and L2 in Fig. 1(b) following Ref. [16]. Next, we use the resulting noise model to compute the noisy observable via a classical Clifford simulation which contains only the noise for the CNOT gates. Crucially, the error rates of conjugate Pauli pairs, i.e., P and UPU † (where P is a Pauli and U the unitary of the CNOT layer) can only be inferred as a product by this noise learning protocol. However, the simulation requires specifying individual rates which introduces degrees of freedom. Initially, we split the product symmetrically, as supported by recent theoretical work up to leading order [57]. Finally, we solve two optimization problems that adjust the splits of conjugate Pauli pairs to either maximize or minimize the measured observable under the constraint of all Pauli fidelities remaining physical, i.e., ≤1. This results in the shaded area in Fig. 1(e). As these optimization problems are non-convex, we don’t know whether the solutions we find are the global optima. This may also explain why the data on four qubits in Fig. 1(c) lies outside of the gray area. We have opted for this procedure out of simplicity as it suffices to highlight the importance of separating state-preparation and measurement noise. The resulting spread in possible observable values is large. With additional noise learning circuits, the noise model of the CNOT gate layers could be further constrained by implementing interleaved cycle benchmarking [29], multi- layer cycle benchmarking [58], or a self-consistent gate set learning scheme [31].",
      "Learning the state-preparation error precisely neces- sitates stable state preparation in the computational basis. Therefore, we employ a simple passive reset by waiting more than 5 −10 × T1 when initializing qubits. This results in a thermal state with a population fol- lowing a Boltzmann distribution [34]. Therefore, the probability to find the transmon in the excited state is psp = exp(−ℏω01/kBTeff). Here, ω01 is the energy differ- ence between the first excited state and the ground state, see Fig. 1(c). The effective temperatures of superconduct- ing qubits Teff are typically above the 15 mK temperature of dilution refrigerators. Furthermore, the population of the second excited state |2⟩is often negligible [35], see also Appendix A 1. After a passive reset the qubit is thus in the thermal state ρth = (1 −psp) |0⟩ ⟨0| + psp |1⟩ ⟨1| with typical psp values in the 1 −10% range. Crucially, psp can be precisely measured by driving an oscillation in the |1⟩↔|2⟩subspace with the R12(θ) gate and comparing it to a reference oscillation [35, 36], see Fig. 1(d). The proba- bility psp is estimated from the amplitudes of the no-pi ( \u001a π) signal and the reference, or pi (π), signal, see Appendix A. This procedure, also known as a RabiEF experiment [37], provides a direct measurement of the state-preparation error psp of a passive reset. Through the comparison to a reference oscillation, which is equally affected by measure- ment errors, the RabiEF experiment is mostly insensitive to measurement noise, see Appendix A 2. We can thus place ourselves in a situation where the state-preparation error is well known and measurable with sufficient accu- racy by passively resetting the qubit.",

      "Here, we discuss the experimental thermal state data presented in Fig. 1 which is taken on qubits 114 to 121 on the IBM Quantum device ibm pinguino3. The thermal populations of these qubits are measured with RabiEF after a 10 ms passive reset. The resulting |1⟩state pop- ulation α ranges from 3.06 to 8.75 %, see Tab. III, and creates a significant state-preparation error. From the measured population α in the |1⟩state we compute an effective qubit temperature Teff following the relation α = exp[−ℏω01/(kbTeff)]. The resulting effective temper- atures, shown in Tab. III, are larger than the ∼15 mK of dilution refrigerators. We then use the above relation to estimate the population in the second excited state by replacing ω01 with 2ω01 + ∆, where ∆is the transmon anharmonicity. The resulting populations β are at least an order of magnitude lower than their corresponding populations α in the first excited state. This justifies the assumption that the |2⟩-state population is negligible when slow resets are used.",
      "In Sec. III B, we split the error mitigation of SPAM errors. This requires a slow passive reset when learning the TREX correction factor ⟨Z⋆⟩and when running the circuit in Fig. 1(b) to keep fsp consistent across all executed circuits. Furthermore, this correction is possible because the circuit only has Clifford gates. We can thus compute which qubits affect the raw observable resulting in Eq. (1). By contrast, a general and ideal error mitigation protocol is (i) fast, and (ii) mitigates both state-preparation and final measurement errors for general circuits. We could avoid slow resets by executing a RabiEF experiment on the initial state resulting from a fast, active reset, consisting of a measurement and a feedforward X gate conditioned on measuring a |1⟩. For a RabiEF experiment to function properly, the reset must always prepare the same initial state of the form (1−psp) |0⟩⟨0|+ psp |1⟩⟨1|, i.e., with a negligible |2⟩-state population. If such a reliable fast reset is available, we propose a noise",
      "We now show classical simulations of our method on the stabilizer circuit in Fig. 1(a). The simulations use the same slow reset fidelity as in Secs. IV A and IV B, and implement both TREX and the mitigation from Eq. (1). These simulations, done with Qiskit Aer, do not simu- late leakage, as the |2⟩-state is assumed negligible for all experiments except RabiEF. The TREX mitigator ⟨Z⋆⟩is learned with 16 twirling randomizations and 5000 shots per randomization, for n = 4, 6, 8, 10 qubits, i.e., the same as in Sec. II. The measurement and state-preparation noise fidelities were taken from Sec. IV B. The stabilizer circuit was simulated for n = 4, 6, 8, 10 qubits, with 128 shots per twirling ran- domization, and 210 × n2 total shots. With the hardware experiments, we compare our mitigated results to Clif- ford simulations with CNOT noise. By contrast, here we assume ideal gates to compare the mitigated expectation values to their ideal value of +1, the dashed green line in",
      "The RabiEF experiment measures the population α in the excited state of the qubit for a state ρ = (1−α) |0⟩⟨0|+ α |1⟩⟨1| [36]. RabiEF drives oscillations in the {|1⟩, |2⟩} subspace with a R12(θ) gate which rotates around the X-axis of the corresponding Bloch sphere. Measuring α requires two independent experiments called π and no- π, indicated by \u001a π. In the π-experiment we apply the gate sequence X −R12(θ) −X while the no-π-experiment omits the first X gate. The difference between both experiments is thus the π-pulse on the thermal state at the beginning of the gate sequence. Following this gate sequence, which we assume is ideal, we apply a noisy measurement with discrimination errors. This results in two oscillating signals sπ(θ) and s\u0001 π(θ) which we fit to two independent functions of the form a sin2(θ + c) + b, see Fig. 1(d). Here, a, b, and c are the fit parameters. Finally, the excited state population α is estimated by",
      "via a Clifford simulation, details are in Appendix C. Since we can only learn the CNOT noise up to the unlearnable degrees of freedom, we compute upper and lower bounds for the ideal observable with only CNOT noise, repre- sented as the shaded area in Fig. 1(e), assuming physical noise channels. This area represents the possible range for ⟨O⟩raw after removing SPAM errors, and therefore ⟨O⟩mit falling within this area indicates success. The two experi- ments with six and eight qubits fall well within this area. The experiment with four qubits does not. Out-of-model errors, such as non-Markovian noise and noise generators with a weight greater than two, may cause this [38].",

Superconducting qubit measurements return complex values in the IQ plane [33] to which we apply a principal component analysis to forgo classification and instead use the projected signals s′ π(A) ∝sπ(θ) and s′ \u0001 π(A) ∝s\u0001 π(θ). These signals have arbitrary units and can be larger than 1 owing to the location of the reference points in the IQ plane, see Fig. 1(d). Crucially, gate and measurement errors tend to cancel out in Eq. (A1) as they affect aπ and a\u0001 π in the same way.",

      "Qiskit Aer does not support correlated errors between qubits and classical bits. Therefore, we implement Λc in Fig. 2 with a dummy delay instruction post- measurement to which we attach an X error. This post- measurement error is equivalent to a correlated error pre-measurement, which can be seen by back propagat- ing the X Pauli through the measurement in the CNOT picture. Therefore, an X gate post-measurement with probability pc = (1 −fc)/2 is equivalent to a correlated error pre-measurement with the same probability. We set the duration of the delay to 0 to ensure that no additional error channels are attached to it. To simulate a given prepared initial state, we prepend reset instructions to the MCB and mitigation circuits, and attach an X error to them with probability psp. This forces Qiskit Aer to prepare the state ρsp = (1 − psp) |0⟩ ⟨0| + psp |1⟩ ⟨1|. The measurement outcomes re- turned by Qiskit Aer are post-processed to obtain the expectation values in Figs. 5 and 6.",

To construct the PTM, we represent a measurement as a CNOT gate targeting the classical bit controlled by the qubit, and a subsequent measurement on the qubit; see Fig. 2. The model of the noisy measurement is built using the principle of deferred measurement [40]. Our measurement noise model includes three possible error channels.

      "Therefore, we consider an imperfect qutrit reset which discriminates between |0⟩, |1⟩, and |2⟩[41, 42] and applies the feedforward I, X, and XX12 gates, depending on the respective outcomes. We simulate RabiEF experiments on qutrits with ideal qubit gates embedded in SU(3), e.g., X = |1⟩⟨0|+|0⟩⟨1|+ |2⟩⟨2|. Thermal relaxation and measurement errors are included as separate operations, attached to appropriate circuit instructions. To investigate how state-preparation removes the |2⟩-state population we perform density ma- trix simulations of RabiEF with N = 1000 shots and 40 rotation angles θ ∈[0, 4π] for R12(θ). This is done for fast qubit reset, slow qubit reset, fast qutrit reset, and slow qutrit reset. The projected post-measurement state ρk−1 of the previous RabiEF circuit and shot is the input to the repetition delay of the next circuit, as was done in Ref. [43], see Fig. 4(a)-(b). This allows us to observe how post-measurement states and imperfect qutrit reset con- taminate subsequent shots. The measurement outcomes are saved, alongside all input states ρsp,k, see Fig. 4. See Appendix F 1 for more details on the simulation setup. Our simulations include three active resets inter-spaced in a 250 µs repetition delay since multiple reset instruc- tions increas the fidelity of initializing the transmon [44]. The long delay for passive resets is set to 10 ms. We simulate thermal relaxation of the qutrit during all idle times and measurements. Measurement errors are mod- eled as thermal relaxation, measurement-induced leakage, and readout signal misclassifications. Misclassifications are simulated with a readout assignment error matrix R, storing probabilities qjk to misclassify |k⟩as |j⟩.

      "An active qubit reset is a qubit measurement followed by a feedforward X gate conditioned on measuring the |1⟩ state that can be used for qubit initialization. Here, the qubit measurement misclassifies the |2⟩state as |1⟩, owing to the overlap of their complex readout signals [25, 41]. Such active resets are ineffective at removing the |2⟩-state population as they only implement binary classification and the feedforward X gate does not interact with |2⟩. In Sec. II, this was overcome with a long passive reset before executing each circuit, which we call slow reset, see Fig. 4(a). Fast reset forgoes this long delay, relying only on active resets in the repetition delay, see Fig. 4(b). Qubit measurements with fast resets cause distortions in the RabiEF signals, owing to their poor |2⟩-state re- set, which contaminates the estimates of psp in Eq. (8).",

Next, we mimic the readout process by sampling from N(µ, σm) and assigning a count of 1 if the result is greater than 0. Therefore, the overlap between the two Gaussian distributions N(µ = −1, σm) and N(µ = 1, σm) — controlled by σm — creates measurement assignment errors, see inset in Fig. 9(b). The relation between σm and the readout fidelity F = 1 −[P(1|0) + P(0|1)]/2 is shown in Fig. 9(b). Even in the presence of strong assignment errors, e.g., σm > 0.4 for which F < 99%, RabiEF accurately mea- sures α. The estimates ˆ α center around the ideal value set to 1.5 %, see Fig. 9(a). Furthermore, the magnitude of the error bars, correspondingly the standard deviation of the distribution of independent measures, increases with the assignment error, see Fig. 9(b). Crucially, we can reduce these errors by increasing the number of shots, see Fig. 10. Here, the distribution of measurements is again centered around the ideal value. Importantly, increasing the shots reduces the variance of the distribution. These results are expected given assignment errors, and potentially other imperfections, affect both aπ and a\u0001 π.",

      "To experimentally demonstrate the scheme outlined above, a standard injection-lock setup22 was built and modified by adding components for active stabilization and additional diagnostics (FIG. 2). A 729 nm laser diode (Thorlabs HL7302MG) is housed in a mount with integrated thermo- electric element (Thorlabs LDM56/M) and its temperature and current are governed by a digital laser diode driver (Ko- heron CTL200-0), which in turn is controlled via a PID con- troller (TEM Messtechnik LaseLock). The seed light from a titanium-sapphire laser (MSquared SolsTiS) is delivered to the setup via an optical fiber. This type of source allows for a con- tinuous sweep of the laser wavelength over a large frequency range to probe the robustness of the injection lock. A Faraday isolator is used to isolate the ILD from any back-reflections, as well as to inject the seed light via its third port. A half- wave plate (W2) is used to match the polarization exiting the Faraday isolator to that of the laser diode. The section marked in blue in FIG. 2 shows three com- monly used tools for diagnosing the state of injection-locked lasers, namely a narrowband filter (Thorlabs FBH730-10, with the incidence angle chosen to optimally separate the free-running wavelength of the ILD from the seed laser wavelength), an optical spectrum analyser (Ocean Optics HR2 VIS-NIR), and a scanning Fabry-Pérot cavity (Thorlabs SA30-73). These tools are not required for normal operation of our scheme and are only used as additional diagnostic tools for characterization purposes.

      "Watanabe’s Ugly Duckling theorem [1–3] states that if similarity is defined by counting shared predicates, then every pair of distinct objects is equally similar. Formally, in a universe Ω, the number of predicates true of both x and y — equivalently, the number of subsets O ⊆Ω containing both — is 2|Ω|−2, independent of x and y. Thus, when all predicates are weighted equally, all pairs of objects become indiscriminable. The theorem sharpened Goodman’s earlier philosophical claim—that induction depends on which predicates are privileged [32]—into a combinatorial statement. To connect this symmetry with algorithmic information theory, we reinterpret programs as predicates. In the standard view, U(p) = x means that program p outputs x. In our reformulation, U(p) is seen as a set O of admissible objects, with x ∈U(p) interpreted as “x satisfies predicate p”. As illustrated in Fig. 2, this bridges Watanabe’s set-theoretic formulation with the program-based language of algorithmic information theory. It also reveals the limitation of the original theorem: uniformly counting predicates erases distinctions, but once predicates are weighted by description length, shorter programs dominate. This observation motivates the statistical-mechanical framework we develop, where predicates are treated as programs and similarity arises from ensembles weighted by their complexity.",

      "To recap the general principle behind mapping isomet- ric tensor networks to quantum circuits, consider an MPS in right-canonical form (left pointing isometry arrows) with bond dimension χ and physical Hilbert space di- mension d = 2, as shown in Fig. 4. Starting from the left end, the first isometric tensor can be expanded into a uni- tary acting on a physical qubit initialized to some fixed state, typically |0⟩∈C2 and a bond qudit of dimension χ, typically also initialized to |0⟩∈Cχ; the bond qudit can also be viewed as a register of log2(χ) qubits. The isometry is expanded into a unitary by adding orthogo- nal columns that dictate the action of the gate when the physical qubit is in any state orthogonal to the desired one, e.g. |1⟩. The unitary derived from the tensor on the second site acts on a fresh physical qubit in |0⟩and the bond qubit from the first site, which carries correla- tions from site to site. In this way, a length L MPS can be sequentially prepared by a depth L circuit, nominally using L qubits [16]. This idea directly carries over to all isometric tensor networks and in particular to the 2D geometries depicted in Fig. 1. A bond dimension χ uni-isoTNS corresponds to a depth O(Lx + Ly) state preparation circuit; for exam- ple, the 3 × 3 uni-isoTNS shown in Fig. 5(a) corresponds to a depth 5 circuit preparing the 9 qubit state. At each time step t, the unitary gates corresponding to the ten- sors a Manhattan distance t from the OC (upper right) can be applied in parallel. Once again, the light cone pic- ture plays an important role here. Gates with space-like separation can be applied simultaneously. Additionally, the notion of past and future causal cones indicates which gates in the circuit can affect physical observables on sites and thus affect the pattern of entanglement generated. A circuit diagram for the resulting sequential quantum cir- cuit is shown in Fig. 5(c). Alt-isoTNS corresponds to a drastically different cir- cuit, as due to the alternating isometry conditions in the columns, typically only one unitary gate can be applied at each time step [40]. As an example, consider the 3 × 3 alt-isoTNS in Fig. 5(b) and the resulting sequential quan- tum circuit in Fig. 5(d). One sequentially acts all of the unitaries in the orthogonality column (down the right- most column in Fig. 5(b)) and then crosses over into the next column, sequentially applying gates against the di- rection of the isometry arrows (up the middle column in Fig. 5), and so on in a snake-like pattern for the remain- ing columns. Thus, alt-isoTNS corresponds to a depth",
      "FIG. 5: (a) Uni- and (b) alt-isoTNS when viewed as sequential quantum circuit to prepare a 9 qubit state. All bond dimensions are χ = 2, so each line represents a qubit. Different qubits are drawn in different colors. The label of the tensors corresponds to the time-step when the gate can be applied. Dotted lines indicate input qubits in the state |0⟩. Due to isometry conditions on each tensor, the vertical bond dimension in the left-most column is χ = 1. (c) [(d)] Quantum circuit diagrams for uni-[alt-]isoTNS, where isometric tensors have been expanded into unitary gates acting on up to 3 qubits by adding orthogonal columns. Gates act on the qubits that continue through the rectangle. Gates with the same number act on disjoint sets of qubits and thus can be applied simultaneously.",
      "[40] Due to the isometry conditions on each tensor, with phys- ical dimension d = 2 one cannot have a non-trivial uni- form bond dimension χ > 1 for all virtual legs at the boundary. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b), the verti- cal bond dimensions of the leftmost column (i.e. furthest from the OC) are trivial. Thus, tensors in the final col- umn, when viewed as a gates of the resulting quantum circuit, quantum circuit, can be applied in parallel with other gates. This is a boundary effect. For alt-isoTNS, only one unitary gate can be applied at each time step inside the bulk. Therefore, the depth of an alt-isoTNS circuit is O(Lx · Ly)."

      "multilevel ancilla systems to design these unitary opera- tions with the construction methodology similar to that of the qutrit ancilla system and detailed in [35]. These uni- tary operations can be implemented in platforms such as trapped ions and 3D superconducting microwave cavities, using SNAP gates or GRAPE-based optimal control [50– 56]. In principle, arbitrary unitary operations on the system can be achieved through optimal control tech- niques. As an example, we consider a superconducting cavity coupled to a transmon, where the composite gate ˆ U is realized by controlling the quadratures ˆ x and ˆ p of the bosonic mode, achieving a ﬁdelity exceeding 0.99 [35]. The control ﬁelds can be ﬂexibly adjusted to enhance the performance further, but such reﬁnements are beyond the scope of this work. We assume that the waiting time between successive QEC cycles is much longer than the duration of the recov- ery operations. Therefore, we eﬀectively consider these operations ideal by neglecting any possible errors induced during their implementation. In Fig. 3, we present the simulated mean ﬁdelities of the autonomous QEC protocol for various waiting times τw, enabled by the measurement- free implementation. A squeezing level of approximately 8 dB and a photon loss to dephasing rate ratio κ/κϕ ≈8.5 are used as examples, consistent with current experimen- tal parameters [51, 53, 54, 57–60]. The mean ﬁdelity averaged over the code space surpasses the break-even point—the threshold at which QEC outperforms an unpro- tected qubit—and improves as the waiting time shortens. This stems from the increased accuracy of the short-time approximation and the reduced probability of multiple errors per cycle. Our scheme is compatible with various experimental platforms, including trapped ions and 3D",

      "The central idea of quantum trajectory unraveling is to in- terpret open system evolution as a stochastic process over (non-unitary) normalized pure-state evolutions. For each layer, starting from a state vector ∣𝜓⟩the effect of the computa- tional layer Λ is unraveled by specifying a particular Kraus representation {𝐾𝑖}𝑖of the channel and obtaining the induced ensemble decomposition as per Eq. (4). Put into words, Eq. (4) is a statement that the output state is a probabilistic average over the distribution 𝒑= {𝑝𝑖}𝑖of normalized state vectors {∣𝜙𝑖⟩= 𝑝−1/2 𝑖 𝐾𝑖∣𝜓⟩}𝑖. This procedure is represented graphi- cally in Fig. 2 (bottom left). Note that one has the freedom to choose the Kraus decomposition of the channel. This dif- ferent choice of unraveling is synonymous with a different 𝑈 in Eq. (5), and it is precisely this freedom we will leverage to optimize the algorithm in Section IV B. We now expose how to perform the update efficiently when using MPS and few-qubit unitaries, followed by single-qubit noise channels. From here on out, we consider 1D architectures of geometrically local, few-qubit, unitary gates composed with local (single-qubit) noise channels, like for instance the brickwork- like circuit structure shown in Fig. 2 (top left). This setting could be made more general, but it already contains all the key elements to set the stage for our locally entanglement- optimal unraveling. Let us describe each block individually. Given a pure state represented as an MPS of bond dimension 𝜒, the action of a unitary gate is obtained by contracting the (four-legged) tensor with the affected MPS tensors and then recovering the MPS structure through SVD.",
      "One is thus given a trade-off between cost and simulation error. The approximation error for the layer, computed efficiently, is added to the cumulated error of simulating the trajectory. Note that in practical implementations, not focused on deterministic calculations, one could variationally look for the closest MPS with the target bond dimension and compute an approximation error from the resulting overlap [41, 63]. Repeating this procedure (unitary evolution, noise process, truncation) for every layer returns one of the (at most 4𝑛𝐿) trajectories of the full noisy circuit, as visualized in Fig. 2. An algorithmic description of the MPS-based unraveling of a single noise channel is presented in Algorithm 1. Note that the layering process also affects the accuracy and cost of the simulation. Although not central to our work, we outline two methods for interleaving unitary action, noise process, and truncation to illustrate the concept. One layering option is to define the unitary layer as ⌊𝑛/2⌋two-qubit unitary gates, the noise layer as the tensor product of 𝑛single-qubit noise channels, and then a truncation on all bonds",
      "FIG. 2. Graphical representation of the unraveling of quantum trajectories based on matrix product states, for noisy circuits Consider the setting of one-dimensional noisy circuits, composed of (two-)local unitary gates, followed by single-qubit noise channels (top left). The unitary gates are dealt with by the standard MPS contraction. The noise results in a statistical mixture of pure states. This mixture is then unraveled to sample one trajectory, and the resulting state is truncated to the allowed bond dimension. The trajectory sampling results from computing the probabilities of each path and sampling one of them, thus applying the corresponding Kraus operator (bottom). Before that, the unraveling is chosen. In our case, we do so based on the computation of the entanglement of formation of the affected effective two-qubit state (top right).",
      "where ∣𝜓′⟩denotes the (sub-normalized) approximate version of ∣𝜓⟩where each bond has been truncated (represented graph- ically in Fig. 2, top right). For simplicity, let us consider that all bonds are truncated to a maximum bond dimension 𝜒. MPS then allow for the efficient computation in poly(𝑛, 𝜒) time of many quantities of interest. These include inner products with other MPS of bond dimension ≤𝜒, expectation values of MPO observables, index marginalization, and, importantly, computing the Schmidt decomposition across a cut in the MPS. The latter implies the computation of the entanglement entropy across any cut of the linear structure, as the squared singular values over the cut (after adequately shifting the orthogonality center) are the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix obtained from tracing out the left or right part of the cut.",

      "(40) Since the rotation is a local operation with respect to the bipartition of interest (it does not affect the target qubit in any way), it also does not change the entanglement between the two subsystems. We have therefore found an optimal decomposition of the noisy 𝑛-qubit state when the noise channel is only applied to a single qubit. In practice, on MPS, after applying the single qubit noise model and finding the optimal decomposition, one can sample one state from the decomposition (39) and then contract the non-physical index back with the rest of the MPS from Eq. (35). This is sampling one state vector ∣𝜙eff 𝑖⟩and retrieving the sample of the 𝑛-qubit evolution by computing ∣𝜙opt 𝑖⟩= (1 ⊗𝑉)∣𝜙eff 𝑖⟩.

We see this pattern more generally across many instances of Hamiltonians, although sometimes the separations can be less striking. In Fig. 6, we demonstrate this by considering the entanglement and truncation error behavior of competing unravelings when averaged over many randomly selected Hamiltonians. As per Fig. 5, we observe a hierarchy of performance where our unraveling improves on the Haar Optimal one, which itself outperforms the Orthogonal one. We note that, as expected, performance improvements within this hierarchy tend to be less marked for extremal levels of noise and bond dimension. As expected, our performance improvement over the Haar Optimal unraveling diminishes in settings with low noise and strongly coupled non-integrable Hamiltonians where we expect the local entanglement structure of the system to be similar to that of Haar random states.",

Let us first discuss the case where each gate is drawn ran- domly from the Haar distribution. As discussed in Section V B, for Haar random states, our unraveling and the Haar Optimal unraveling become equivalent. As a consequence, in this Haar random gates setting we expect and observe these two unravel- ing to perform similarly. For all three noise models considered here, the simulations yielded similar ensemble-averaged en- tanglement entropy values for our adaptive unraveling and the Haar Optimal one (see Appendix J). For the two unital chan- nels (depolarizing and dephasing), the Orthogonal unraveling is a mixed-unitary unraveling and hence does not affect the entanglement growth, while our unraveling perform best. As previously shown in Refs. [43–45], we observed that the Projec- tive unravelings result in smaller values of ensemble-averaged entanglement entropy than the Mixed-Unitary unravelings but under-perform against our unraveling. For amplitude damping, our unraveling also outperforms the Orthogonal one. We now consider the case of small rotations of random circuits, where each gate is a small-angle rotation around a randomly generated Hermitian matrix (as per Fig. 8). For such circuits, when the acting noise is depolarizing or dephasing, our unraveling shows consistently lower values of entanglement entropies than all other unravelings, including the Haar Optimal one, as shown in Fig. 7 (a) to (c).

The Haar Optimal unraveling itself is being outperformed by our locally entanglement-optimal unraveling. Surprisingly, the improvement from the locally entanglement- optimal over Haar Optimal unraveling was not to be found for amplitude damping in the low-entangling random circuits (see Appendix J). We associate this observation with the fact that the Haar Optimal unraveling is not only optimal for Bell states under amplitude damping noise but for any state whose Schmidt decomposition is in the computational basis (see Appendix G 2). Since the small rotation unitaries do not rotate the state much, and the noise pushes it towards the all-zero state, the states remain close to states with Schmidt decompositions in the computational basis. This hypothesis is confirmed by slightly changing the circuit definition to include Haar random single- qubit rotations after each two-qubit small-angle unitary, as shown in Fig. 8 (c). The single-qubit gates do not affect the entanglement between qubits, but they randomize the basis of the Schmidt decomposition. For random circuits composed of such gates, our unraveling again outperforms the Haar Optimal unraveling, as shown in Fig. 7 (d). We also note that the depth of the simulation is insufficient to reach the saturation value of the average entanglement for the smaller noise rates.

Panel (a) shows the growth of the entanglement with circuit depth for some noise rates of depolarizing noise on low-entangling random circuits. Note that the shaded area labeling noise rates excludes the Mixed-Unitary unraveling, as those curves overlap for all noise rates.

      "The QLBM algorithm is implemented using quantum circuits. As sketched in Fig. 2, the flow field is firstly transformed into 𝑓eq, 𝑗, and then 𝑓eq, 𝑗is encoded into the quantum state |𝛹⟩at the node level using Eqs. (1), (5), and (13). Then, |𝛹⟩sequentially undergoes the transport step, collision step, and H-step. In our QLBM algorithm, both the transport and collision steps in Eqs. (3) and (2) exhibit the crucial features for developing an efficient quantum algorithm as follows. Linearity: the constant coefficients in Eqs. (3) and (2) do not vary with 𝒏or 𝒙. Positivity: all coefficients, 𝛾≥0 in Eq. (3) and 𝑛𝑗/𝜌𝑛≥0 in Eq. (2), are non-negative. Preserving the 𝐿1-norm P 𝒙,𝒏|𝑝𝒙,𝒏|: the initial one is set to be unity, and the sums of the coefficients in Eqs. (3) and (2) remain unity. We will illustrate the quantum algorithm using the D2Q4 model [S3], owing to its mathematical simplicity. The generalization to other DdQq models is straightforward and will be discussed in Sec. 2 F. The D2Q4 model considers the 2D field (𝜌, 𝑢, 𝑣) for an incompressible, constant-density flow on a lattice consisting of 𝑁= 𝑁𝑥× 𝑁𝑦nodes. The particle velocity at each node can take 𝒆1 = (1, 0), 𝒆2 = (0, 1), 𝒆3 = (−1, 0), or 𝒆4 = (0, −1). The initial density 𝜌= 1 is set at all nodes.",
      "The distribution function 𝑓𝑗can deviate from its equilibrium state 𝑓eq, 𝑗in transport and collision steps. Meanwhile, the gas dynamics theory suggests that 𝑓𝑗must be close to 𝑓eq, 𝑗, so that LBM or LGCA can be approximated by the NS equations [S10]. Thus, we introduce an additional H-step to keep 𝑓𝑗near 𝑓eq, 𝑗by re-setting |𝛹⟩in a separable form as in Eq. (12), and quantify the deviation between 𝑓𝑗and 𝑓eq, 𝑗using the H-function (Gibbs entropy). The equilibrium state corresponds to the maximum H-function. In the implementation of transport and collision steps, insufficient growth of H-function can occur due to the entanglement among | 𝑓𝑗⟩(see Fig. 3 and Sec. 3). The H-step comprises two stages given by Eqs. (4) and (5), which first transforms 𝑝𝒙,𝒏from the node level (blue panels in Fig. 2) to 𝑓𝑗at the velocity level (red panels in Fig. 2) and then transforms back to the node level. As elucidated in Sec. 3, the H-step transforms a general 𝑝𝒏into the independence one 𝑝ind,𝒏defined in Eq. (5), corresponding to the growths of the H-function in classical statistical mechanics and the von Neumann entropy in quantum mechanics. The node-to-velocity-level mapping 𝜚↦→𝜚𝑗, whose classical counterpart is Eq. (4), can be implemented by performing a partial trace",
      "sequence. Thus, 𝑝𝒏at the node level is transformed to 𝑝(𝑛𝑗) 𝑗 at the velocity level, which is represented by the diagonal elements of 𝜚𝑗in Eq. (S6), and is associated to 𝑓𝑗in Eq. (1). Note that the encoding of each 𝑓𝑗requires 𝑛𝑄qubits, so the encoding of all 𝑞distribution functions requires a total of 𝑞𝑛𝑄qubits. On the other hand, implementing the velocity-to-node-level mapping 𝜚𝑗↦→𝜚, whose classical counterpart is Eq. (5), presents greater complexity, because each 𝑓𝑗(𝑥, 𝑦) in 𝜚𝑗is associated with its individual coordinate. The goal of 𝜚𝑗↦→𝜚is to integrate all 𝑓𝑗(𝑥, 𝑦) in 𝜚𝑗from Eq. (S6) while preserving only a unified coordinate, as defined by 𝜚in Eq. (S3). The derivation and implementation of 𝜚𝑗↦→𝜚is detailed in Sec. 5. Its quantum implementation relies on the state exchange circuit illustrated in Fig. S5(b), by executing this quantum circuit for each qubit encoding 𝒙and performing a partial trace over the extra qubit. The H-step is only applied when the system significantly deviates from equilibrium, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The time interval",

      "that it is possible to reach convergence of the approxi- mate ground-state energy with a Krylov space of limited dimension. While evaluation of the Krylov matrices on the quan- tum computer resolves the issue of memory, which is the main obstacle to scaling on the classical side, the main obstacle on the quantum side is noise. Two major contri- butions are statistical noise due to finite shot sampling, and hardware noise in the device. Algorithmic error from the approximation of time evolutions also enters, but be- low we show numerically that its effects are below the level of the hardware errors. On the other hand, sup- pressing and mitigating those hardware errors proves to be crucial in order to scale the size of the simulation: we apply experimental techniques for this purpose (see Sec. IV in the Supplemental Information for details) as well as keeping the quantum circuit as shallow as pos- sible while maintaining global coupling structure of the Krylov space. To simplify our circuits, we exploit the U(1) symmetry possessed by many condensed matter models including the Heisenberg model we focus on. As a qubit opera- tor, U(1) symmetry can be expressed as conservation of Hamming weight; in terms of spin-1/2 operators it corre- sponds to conservation of the z component of total spin. Equivalently, we can think of the symmetry subspaces as k-particle subspaces, treating ↑(↓) spins as absence (presence) of a particle. Figure 1 shows a sequence of circuits that could in prin- ciple be used to calculate the matrix elements (1). Panel (a) shows the standard Hadamard test, which would be the default tool for such a calculation. Panel (b) illus- trates how we use spin conservation to avoid implement- ing the controlled time evolutions present in the conven- tional Hadamard test: instead, we implement controlled initializations of the reference state |ψ0⟩, and then rely on the fact that the time evolutions preserve the “vacuum state” |00...0⟩up to a classically-calculable phase. As a second simplification, we note that for the ex- act time evolutions, ⟨ψ0|U † j HUk|ψ0⟩= ⟨ψ0|HUk−j|ψ0⟩, which gives us two formally equivalent ways to mea- sure the same matrix element, with the second yielding a simpler circuit since it only involves one time evolution. However, once the time evolutions are approximated by Trotterization, these two expressions are no longer equal. In Fig. 1c, we show the circuit corresponding to the latter version. It is not a priori clear whether one should prefer the circuits shown in panels b or c in Fig. 1, purely from a Trotter error perspective. One advantage of Fig. 1b is that it still corresponds to variational optimization in a subspace, since each matrix element still has the form (1). However, even this ceases to be true in the presence of finite sample and device noise [27]. Figure 1c, the ver- sion in which Toeplitz structure is explicitly enforced, is preferable from the perspective of circuit depth for two reasons: it only requires one time evolution, and as a re- sult, the second controlled initialization can be applied as",
      "partitioned the observables into as few locally-commuting sets (measurement bases) as possible, since such sets are co-measurable [7]. The shortened circuits as in the third row of Fig. 1 require conjugating the Hamiltonian terms (4) by the second controlled-initialization circuit, since it is not physically implemented. This yields the same num- ber of Pauli observables since the controlled-initialization is a Clifford circuit, and one can prove that these observ- ables can be partitioned into 2(k+2) measurement bases; see Sec. II in the Supplemental Information. We performed experiments on the Heron R1 processor ibm montecarlo. This is a 133-qubit device with fixed- frequency transmon qubits connected to each other via tunable couplers. Heron processors have faster two-qubit gates (similar in duration to the single-qubit gates) and lower cross-talk compared to the fixed-coupling devices of earlier generations. To further improve the measured ob- servables (see Fig. 1), we used probabilistic error ampli- fication (PEA) [42] and twirled readout error extinction (TREX) [48], which mitigates SPAM errors, to approxi- mate noise-free expectation values. We additionally em- ployed error suppression, in particular Pauli twirling and dynamical decoupling. Details of the error mitigation and suppression are given in Sec. IV of the Supplemental Information. The size of the Krylov space was fixed to D = 10 across all experiments. For a fixed value of k the experiment was",

      "In its simplest form, the quantum phase estimation (QPE) circuit operates on two registers of qubits. The lower register is repeatedly acted on by a controlled-U operator, where the control qubits are in the upper register. An inverse quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is then applied to the upper register, which serves as the estimator for an n-bit estimate of the phase θ. Applying this circuit block to a 16-qubit case, we obtain the following quantum circuit. Figure 5 illustrates the basic setup for QPE. To encode any arbitrary distance matrix to a format suitable for the QPE algorithm, we first normalize the values in raw distance matrix such that all the values are in between 0 and 1. We do this so that any such value can be represented by euler phase angles(the exponents are the phase angles which lie between 0 and 2π ).",

      "The remaining Hamiltonian terms all have contributions from the gauge field operators, which will more strictly depend on the specific LGT being considered. At this point, we will restrict to SU(2) and SU(3) LGTs. The simplest of the gauge terms is the electric field term, which again will be fast-forwarded. In SU(2), the Casimir operator is given by Eq. (10) and in SU(3) by Eq. (12). The cost of implementing these operators can be determined again using the circuit for fast-forward evolution in Fig. 2. For SU(2), either the QROM or Karatsuba integer multipli- cation can be used, as before, to implement a unitary Uk which prepares the eigenvalues of the Casimir operators, depending on the bosonic truncation parameter Λ. Here, we provide resource estimates using a QROM as it outperforms integer multiplication for physically relevant values of Λ. On the other hand, for SU(3), there are now two representation indices characterizing the action of the Casimir operator meaning a QROM will scale as O(Λ2). The alternative approach of implementing the integer arithmetic on-the-fly will also require more work. In addition to the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm [94], we also require algorithms for inte- ger addition [101] and integer division [102]. There is again a tradeoff in optimal complexity depending on Λ. Numerically, for Λ ≲90, the QROM is more efficient. The associated complexities are then given by",
      "Within the interaction picture, the only term of the Hamiltonian that is simulated without block encoding is the electric field term HE as it is diagonal in the electric field basis and can be fast-forwarded [92]. Applying the HHKL algorithm [86], the electric field term is decomposed spatially into blocks B and we are only tasked with determining the circuit complexity of time-evolving HB E, the electric field within a single block. We efficiently simulate the time evolution from HB E using a general circuit for simulating diagonal operators in Fig. 2 [93, Rule 1.6]. Here, Uk is a unitary which takes an electric field eigenstate and prepares a binary representation of the associated eigenvalue on an ancilla register to p bits of precision. In general, the eigenvalues of the Casimir operators for LGTs are products of the representation indices, so one way of efficiently implementing Uk is via a Karatsuba-based integer multiplier quantum circuit [94]. This algorithm requires 4p2 −3p Toffoli gates and linear in p ancilla space. However, for the special case of U(1), we note that given an eigenstate |k⟩, we only need to prepare the eigenvalue k2 on the ancilla register to p = ⌈log Λ2⌉= ⌈2 log Λ⌉bits of precision. Squaring an integer can be",

For block encoding, the Hamiltonian must be rescaled such that ∥H∥max ≤1, i.e. the maximum matrix element value is at most |1|. This amounts to scaling the Hamiltonian by (N d B/2)−1. To accomplish this, we will construct oracles for the unnormalized Hamiltonian and at the end of the computation append additional ancilla qubits to the result to bit-shift the encoded values. Since the Hamiltonian HM is diagonal, the enumerator oracle OF is implemented via a series of CNOT gates which copy the row index to a new register, as shown in Fig. 4. We omit the bosonic register here for simplicity, as the mass term only acts on the fermionic matter. In order to implement the matrix element value oracle, OH, we first note that the spectrum of HM ranges from −N d B/2 to N d B/2.

      "is required and for SU(3) (in the worst case) eleven additional registers are required, each of size O(log Λ). With this approach, computing the final states amounts to performing only controlled-increments and controlled-decrements on the state indices. Additionally, with each non-zero final state stored in its own register, then the unique matrix element values for each state can be computed in OH on these separate registers. While we make use of the approach involving additional state registers for computing resource requirements, we also provide some alternative, less intuitive, approaches one could employ. First, rather than storing each entire final state, we can include an O(1) size register of indicator qubits which determine the final state we are in. In SU(2), for example, the action of the gauge field operator would map |j⟩7→{|j⟩|0⟩, |j⟩|1⟩} where the state of the indicator qubit corresponds to the states j ± 1/2 . However, since computing the matrix element values in OH requires arithmetic, the explicit circuit construction would require additional controlled operations on the indicator qubit to prepare the correct binary represenation of the state prior to doing the arithmetic. Another alternative approach applicable only to SU(2) involves decomposing the gauge field operators into sums of one- sparse terms, which are easy to encode via the sparse access oracles [103]. For the magnetic field term HB, though, this amounts to exchanging the sums of the gauge-field operators and the trace operation over the plaquettes, which is only possible in SU(2), as the isospin parameters in SU(3) are color-dependent. Using the approach to store each entire final state, for the bosonic part in SU(2) the non-zero final states |J, ML, MR⟩are constructed via a series of increments or decrements, similar to the U(1) case. However, for SU(2), we now need six increments or decrements for each gauge field operator with fixed color indices, three for each of the |j ± 1/2⟩final states. Thus, in Fig. 8, we can replace each controlled-SID gate with six controlled-SID gates (three to each of the two registers storing the two final states). The rest of the logic will follow exactly as in the U(1) case. For SU(3), the generalization is similar. The isospin and hypercharges will be incremented or decremented according to the fixed color indices. However, unlike SU(2), the SU(3) gauge field operators have sums over T ′ L and T ′ R in addition to the sum over the representation indices. While T ′ L and T ′ R are color-dependent, tL, tR ∈{0, 1/2}, so in the worst case, we obtain at most four additional non-zero final states. Thus, there are a total of twelve non- zero final states, each one requiring either seven or eight controlled-SID gates. So each controlled-decrement gate in Fig. 8 will now be replaced with 88 controlled-SID gates. The resulting complexities for the gauge-matter and magnetic field term then become",

Then the action of the bosonic operators is performed. Based on the ordering imposed by the VC-encoding, the first non-zero bit in aℓindicates the physical site that the link originates from and the third non-zero bit indicates the physical site at which the link terminates (the second and fourth non-zero bits act on auxiliary fermions and do not affect the bosonic links). Note that imposing an ordering of the vertical links, namely that bosonic operators propagate from a starting site downward, elim- inates the need for indexing on both the initial and terminal sites, so we need only control on the first non-zero bit of aℓ. Thus we control on every other bit of aℓ(corresponding to physical sites) of which there will always be two non-zero bits. To avoid performing two decrements, we introduce a flag qubit. If the flag qubit is off, then the decrement is performed on the corresponding bosonic mode λv ℓ(as will be the case for the first non-zero bit in aℓ) and a successive CNOT flips the state of the flag qubit such that the second non-zero bit of aℓdoes not trigger a decrement.

The dimension normalization prefactor can also be readily computed in this way. For SU(3), the same logic applies, though now the arithmetic is a bit more involved, but still more efficient than implementing a QROM for a database of size O(Λ5).

The state of |z⟩is then mapped uniquely to the matrix element value ±1 or ±i.",
      "While the implementation of OH was trivial for the gauge fields in U(1), it is not so for SU(2) and SU(3) and we must include additional subroutines to the circuit in Fig. 9 to obtain the bosonic matrix element values. In both SU(2) and SU(3), this amounts to computing the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the dimension normalization prefactor. While each of these amplitudes is known a priori, allowing us to use a QROM to classically pre-compute and load these values in, we will see that it is in fact more efficient to do the arithmetic on- the-fly. For SU(2), there are four Clebsch-Gordan coefficients c∆j,∆m indexed by the change in angular momentum ∆j = J −j and change in the z-component of angular momentum ∆m = M −m. However, each of these coefficients is a function of j and m. Since j ∈[0, Λ]",

      "magnetic field Hamiltonian will just consist of a product of four controlled-SID gates, each acting on their respective bosonic modes. As mentioned previously, the enumerator oracle OF is realized by the action of the Hamil- tonian terms on the basis states, as this yields the locations of the non-zero matrix elements. Imposing an enumeration scheme such that the lattice site index ℓfixes the upper left ver- tex of a plaquette uniquely identifies which bosonic modes are acted on by each plaquette term P (ℓ) □. Given that |ℓ⟩is a superposition over binary encoded states, the na¨ ıve way to implement OF is via a series of multi-controlled gates in which there is a unique operation for every possible binary configuration of the controls. The Clifford+T decomposition for such a circuit is not optimal. Instead, we make use of the unary iteration subroutine which converts a binary encod- ing into a successive preparation, then unpreparation, of unary encoded states which only require operations with a single control [18]. Using unary iteration, each lattice site index is successively controlled on and the associated plaquette operator P (ℓ) □ is applied. This is accomplished via the circuit in Fig. 10. The complexity of this oracle combines the cost of unary iteration and the cost of imple- menting four bosonic operators at each lattice site. The full complexity is",

      "tor in state |0⟩and state |1⟩. Note that the two sweep frequencies correspond to each computational spectator basis state after accounting for drive-induced Stark shifts. The effect of Stark shifts grows with drive strength, and therefore decreases with higher J for our re-optimized gates. This relationship is also seen in Fig. 5, where the detuning of fd from the non-driven bright-state frequen- cies decreases when increasing J. However, the stark shift itself is quite insensitive to the spectator state, so its strength is not nearly as important as the increased spectator-dependent frequency splitting at high J. For each value of J, the optimal pulse frequency point main- tains roughly equal detuning from each bright transition frequency. In the presence of a drive, this unavoidable detuning generates “flip” and “phase” errors, which dom- inate our error budget at gate times above 44 ns. Since the drive’s Stark effect shifts the two bright- transition frequencies with less than 1% difference in magnitude when J/h = 22 MHz, the effective detun- ing of CX1 Rabi oscillations is estimated well by ∆eff ≈ |f011−111 −f010−110| /2. An individual “flip” error tran- sition then has an associated probability of approxi- mately Perr ≈(∆/ΩRabi)2 = 4∆2t2 g during the gate. Clearly, in addition to “phase” errors, detuning in the Rabi drive also causes the accumulation of more “flip” errors at longer gate times. This can be seen through the increase in |011⟩→|011⟩probability during the gate when going from a 35 ns pulse to a 100 ns pulse in Fig 5. As such, optimizing gate time and fluxonium-transmon coupling strength corresponds to balancing detuning- induced “phase” and “flip” errors at long gate times with counter-rotating dynamics in short gates. We find that the CX1 gate exhibits a valley of low E in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 by tuning tg and J/h to about 44, ns and 20 MHz, respectively. On the other hand, fluxonium-fluxonium coupling must be kept arbitrarily weak for optimal performance. Increasing its strenth hybridizes fluxonium energy levels, introducing a crosstalk channel for the strongly driven",
      "control qubit. As shown in Fig. 7, the presence of nonzero I, and subsequent involvement of the spectator qubit ru- ins the quality of selectively darkened transitions and bright transitions. Thus, both spectator-control and spectator-target coupling terms introduce parasitic ef- fects to the gate through different mechanisms. In this sense, the spectator fluxonium effectively introduces en- vironmental dephasing into the active qubit subspace.",

      "Our analytical results concern the averaged square of the distance between the second moments of the projected ensemble EC|Ψ⟩and the Haar ensemble. Due to concentration of measure, we expect that this average-of-squares is approximately equal to the square-of-averages for large system sizes, indirectly giving us a way of treating the averaged distance itself. Here, we provide numerical evidence for this conjecture. Using the method described in the main text, we randomly construct Clifford circuits of a fixed depth L = 100 initialized to the product state |Ψ(θ)⟩= 2−N/2(|0⟩+eiθ|1⟩)⊗N for θ = π/4, which maximizes magic for product states of this form. We compute the projected ensemble for each randomly sampled circuit. For varying sizes NA of the unmeasured system, we compute the variance of the normalized trace distance between the second moments of the projected ensemble and the Haar ensemble across a sample of random circuits. Note that the variance is exactly equal to the difference between the average-of-squares and square-of-averages for a sample. These variances are plotted in Fig. 1, and show a clear exponential decay with respect to NA (size of the target random state ensemble subsystem). Here, we only compute the variance over circuits of fixed depth to reduce runtime for larger NA, while in the main text, we extrapolated the sample means to infinite depth to estimate the average over the Clifford group in Fig. 3 (of the main text). However, the decay in the variance already becomes clear at a circuit depth of L = 100. Thus, our numerical experiments suggest that if the size of the A subsystem is sufficiently large, then the squared average of the distance from Haar is approximately equal to the averaged square of this distance.",

      "source across various platforms. We study this on photonic platforms, where noiseless attenuation is generally implemented using zero-photon subtraction (ZPS) [16–18] and has been shown to preserve the coherence of two-component cat states [19]. Subtraction of an arbitrary number of photons from a cat state results in another cat state, while also implementing noiseless attenuation like ZPS. Subtraction of a larger number of photons also gives a higher success probability in many situations. We discuss in some detail the consequences of this for fidelity and success rates. Alternatives to error suppression of the current discussion, where deterministic squeezing is considered instead of multiphoton subtraction, have been explored [20–23]. Recent demonstrations, such as those in Ref. [24] on the circuit-QED platform, encourage interest in active preemptive error suppression. Error filtration [25–27] and channel correction [28] also seek to protect quantum information by suppressing errors. In this work, we similarly analyze a continuous-variable (CV) system that encodes a single qubit and exploit the rotation symmetry of the cat codes. Recently, quantum error mitigation with rotationally symmetric bosonic codes was explored in Ref. [29] which also supports this work. However, we focus on implementing the noiseless loss suppression scheme for photonic platforms and take into account the additional sources of noise that would be involved in its realization. Error mitigation techniques that suppress errors in expectation values during data postprocessing have gained recent attention [30–32], but these are different from active error suppression methods that herald event-ready states of interest here. In these techniques, the quantum state is destroyed during measurements, whereas we would like to preserve the quantum information for later applications. Deterministic phase-preserving linear amplification always adds noise [33,34]. Efficient and noiseless amplification of two-component cat codes become feasible, albeit nondeterministically, with multiple copies of the state as a resource [35–37]. Quantum scissors have been considered for the approximate noiseless amplification of low-amplitude states [38, 39]. Subsequently, teleportation-based noiseless linear amplifiers were introduced for multicomponent cat codes that work exactly [40–42]. We adopt this approach to amplify the amplitudes of the cat states specifically before recovery and generalize the standard teleamplification to herald on a larger set of photon number detections along with multiphoton subtraction for the noiseless attenuation. The recovery for each compatible outcome is appropriately adapted as shown in Fig. 1(e). In our analyses, we prefer to use the worst-case fidelity across all input pure states to characterize the performance. We find that a worst-case fidelity of over 93.5% can be achieved, at a minimum success probability of about 3.42%, under a 10% environmental-loss rate, a realistic 95% detector efficiency, for cat states with the coherent-state amplitudes of as large as 2. The ability to protect such large cat states is quite appealing for quantum information applications in the near term, wherein large passive losses before error correction are unavoidable. Storing photonic qubits in a cavity or long fiber loops, or direct communication of the qubits over long distances provide some near-term examples. These contribute to the development of a distributed quantum network [43]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The preliminaries of photon subtraction, teleamplification, photon losses, and multicomponent cats with some of the notations used throughout are presented in Sec. 2. Section 3 discusses the error suppression for four-component cat codes. Optimal recoveries in Sec. 4 and the results are presented in Sec. 5. The paper ends with a discussion in Sec. 6.",
      "this end, and this is the reason behind the physical-resource efficiency of CV error correction. As the photon losses occur, they cause errors on the encoded information. However, error-correcting codes allow the detection and correction of such errors through a recovery channel R. This includes measuring the syndrome such as the generalized photon number parity of the affected state without destroying the logical superposition, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Different encodings are suited to different kinds of noise, but no realistic encoding can detect and correct for any arbitrary number of photon losses, and therefore we naturally end up in a mixed state in the computational basis. The challenge of error correction is to detect and correct errors faster than they can grow, and there has been great focus in this direction. One way to protect the purity of states is the relatively less known method of noiseless loss suppression, shown in Fig. 1(c). In this scheme, noiseless attenuation is applied to the initial pure state which is an operator 𝜈ˆ 𝑛with the constant factor 𝜈< 1. It results in a state ∝Í∞ 𝑛=0 𝑐𝑛𝜈𝑛|𝑛⟩. Larger 𝑛terms are thus exponentially suppressed, and thus the state is greatly protected against the occurrence of photon losses. Noiseless attenuation is a nonunitary operation and can only be performed nondeterministically. Although it makes the states resilient to possible losses, the redistribution of the probability amplitudes associated with the constituent Fock states can drastically distort the input. The state can be recovered by an effective inverse under noiseless amplification which is simply the operation 𝑔ˆ 𝑛with the factor 𝑔> 1. If 𝑔= 1/𝜈, then (𝜈𝑔) ˆ 𝑛= ˆ 𝐼. In this work, we combine the two approaches to protecting fragile quantum information against",
      "decoherence from photon loss, as shown in Fig. 1(d). We are interested in noiselessly attenuating the physical states of arbitrary computational information encoded in CV encodings before it experiences loss. This will naturally distort the state and take it out of the codespace. It is not obvious at the outset if the encoded states are resilient to such nonunitary distortion, photon loss, and after noiseless amplification, still be able to detect and correct logical errors during recovery. In this work, we find that cat encodings due to their rotational symmetric structure are indeed robust under this procedure and can utilize the advantages of error correction and noiseless loss suppression. Moreover, the particular implementations of noiseless loss suppression for cat states, with photon subtraction and teleamplification, also exhibit another advantage in that an arbitrary number of photon annihilations over these operations, 𝜈ˆ 𝑛and 𝑔ˆ 𝑛, do not affect the encoding. This will be explained in detail in Sec. 3. These photon annihilations are typically an undesirable consequence of realizing noiseless loss suppression and lead to many failed events, for example, when noiseless attenuation is heralded only on the detection of zero photons. However, due to this feature of the cat encoding, we can adapt the recovery channel R over a larger set of events than would be possible if we restricted ourselves to ZPS and the standard teleamplificaiton, as illustrated by Fig. 1(e). In the following, preliminaries of photon subtraction, teleamplification, photon loss channel, and multicomponent cat states are presented. This section also introduces the notation we use throughout the paper.",
      "Fig. 1. (a) A pure photonic state passing through a photon loss channel becomes a mixture. Higher photon number terms in the initial state are more likely to be lost to the environment. (b) The quantum information encoded in the error-correcting codes is recovered after loss. The encoded states are typically a large average photon number. (c) Quantum information is made resilient to noise from photon loss by noiseless loss suppression. Operations with 𝜈< 1 and 𝑔> 1 constitute noiseless attenuation and amplification processes, respectively. It works by suppressing large energy terms. (d) The two approaches are combined, where the states encoded in the error-correcting codes are passed through a loss suppression procedure, which also suppresses uncorrectable logical errors on the encoded states. (e) The procedure is extended to include arbitrary photon annihilations during noiseless attenuation and amplification sections. Error correction is suitably adapted to outcomes obtained during the general photon subtraction and teleamplification.",

      "Quantum neural networks (QNNs) represent a new ap- proach to machine learning, combining classical data process- ing with the power of quantum computing [21, 22, 30]. De- spite their classical foundations, QNNs are considered pure quantum models because their execution depends on classical computing only for circuit preparation and statistical analy- sis [31]. These QNNs fall under Variational Quantum Algo- rithms, employing Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) known as ans¨ atze (plural of ansatz), which are trained using classical optimization techniques. The behavior of quantum neural networks (QNNs) reflects that of classical neural net- works, consisting of three main stages: data preparation, data processing, and data output [31]. In the data preparation stage, the classical input is encoded into a quantum state using a feature map, a circuit parame- terized exclusively by the original data [32]. This coding fa- cilitates the integration of the classical information into the quantum structure of the QNN. In particular, classical data may require pre-processing, such as normalization or scaling, to optimize the coding process [32, 33]. Subsequently, in the data processing stage, the QNN oper- ates within the framework of its ansatz. Usually structured as a layered variational circuit, the ansatz consists of multi- ple layers, each defined by an independent parameter vector. Variational circuits Vj dependent on these parameters make up each layer, with layers of entanglement Ent interspersed. An example of a quantum ansatz is shown in Figure 1. The ansatz effectively processes quantum-coded data, taking advantage of entanglement and parameterized gates for computation. Finally, in the data output stage, the processed quantum state is converted into a classical output via a final layer [31]. This operation is adapted to the specific problem being ad- dressed. For example, in a binary classification, the expected value of a single qubit selected in the measurement can be used as the output [32]. Overall, QNNs offer a promising path for quantum-assisted machine learning, uniting classical and quantum paradigms to address complex computational tasks [21, 22, 32, 33].",

Following [19], we compare loss distributions after one epoch to assess the im- pact of noisy labels on classical and quantum neural net- works. Specifically, we analyze the classical CloudLeak [8] attack for classical model extraction using cross-entropy loss, and QuantumLeak [9] for QNN extraction, which uses a 2- dimensional Huber loss. As shown in Figure 3, classical mod- els tend to learn clean patterns in the initial epochs, allowing small-loss instances to be easily filtered out as clean data. This aligns with the conclusions in [19] and is effectively leveraged in co-teaching [11]. In contrast, this correlation does not exist in QNNs, leading to our fourth observation: • Observation-4: The clean and noisy data are nearly evenly distributed across specific loss values, blurring the distinc- tion between the two. This makes it difficult to effectively filter out clean data based on loss, a method that is typically successful in classical models [11,19].",

      "In the main text, we illustrated the existence of mul- tiple periodic orbits for different values of the bond di- mension χ = 1, . . . , 4. This leads to the natural ques- tion of whether the orbits found at different values of χ are related among themselves and potentially also to the eigenstates of the unitary (16). To investigate this po- tential relation, we study the pairwise distances between orbits at t = 0 using fidelity in Eq. (11). Figure 9 shows the fidelity between the initial points of different orbits. The first periodic orbit χ = 1 is a ceiling state from the main text, and according to the figure, it has relatively small overlaps (at most 0.7) with all remaining orbits. On the other hand, the second orbit found for χ = 1 has a partner χ = 2 orbit, as is witnessed by the considerably larger overlap of 0.95. This partner orbit was analyzed in Sec. III C, where it was shown to be a ground state of the effective Hamiltonian. Note that we did not find further relatives of this orbit at higher bond dimensions (notice the absence of bright colors in the χ > 2 parts of the second row or column of the matrix in Fig. 9). The relation between orbits can be also seen in Fig. 11 in Appendix C 2 below, where we illustrate the overlap of the initial points of the orbit with eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian. In contrast to the first χ = 2 orbit, the second and third χ = 2 orbits have partners in χ = 3 and χ = 4 as is evidenced by the overlap of 0.86 and 0.83 for the second orbit and 0.9, 0.8 for the third one. Despite the intuition that orbits with higher bond dimensions should better represent the eigenstates of the effective Hamil- tonian, in Fig. 4, we do not see a qualitative difference in the IPR scaling between orbits with different χ. One reason for this may be the higher leakage of the under- lying orbits, as the correspondence between eigenstates and orbits is expected to hold only in the low-leakage regime. Another reason may be related to the algorithm for finding the periodic orbits. As we discussed above in Appendices A 1 and A 3, the canonical form and gradient descent algorithms may experience numerical stability is- sues when converging to the state with an effective lower bond dimension.",
      "defined over the complete basis of eigenstates {|φi⟩}D i=1 of the unitary operator, where D is the Hilbert space di- mension. The IPR quantifies how delocalized the MPS is on the basis of eigenstates, and in the case where the eigenstates of the unitary operator are fully chaotic, the weakly entangled MPS is expected to show IPR scal- ing as the inverse size of the Hilbert space dimension, I2 ∼1/D ∼e−sL, thus decreasing exponentially with the system size. Figure 4(a) shows the IPR in the basis of eigenstates for all orbits found for a fixed value of the coupling J = 1.09, see Fig. 1. Note that the Hilbert space di- mension D corresponds to the size of the translationally invariant zero-momentum sector (we do not fix the par- ity sector since not all orbits are parity symmetric, see Appendix B 1). While the majority of MPS states corre- sponding to periodic orbits show the expected exponen- tial scaling of the IPR with L, MPS states corresponding to low-leakage χ = 1 and 2 orbits in Fig. 1 have IPR close to one that is slowly decreasing with L. These two states also appeared to be the ground state (GS) (χ = 2 low- leakage orbit) and ceiling state (CS) (χ = 1 low-leakage orbit) of the effective Hamiltonian, see Appendix C, jus- tifying their names, which were introduced earlier. Focusing on the GS in Fig. 4(b), we show how its IPR scaling changes with the coupling J. The evolution of the IPR scaling with J should be compared to the depen- dence of leakage on J of the same orbit shown in Fig. 3(c). At the smallest values of J, where the orbit has very small leakage, the IPR is close to one and shows almost no decay with the system size, L. This implies that at",

The eigenvalues are determined in a manner that is robust to SPAM by the same noise amplification com- mon to other randomized methods, that is repeated ap- plication Pm(ρ) of the hard cycle to some initial state ρ for different values of m. The eigenvalues are then ob- tained by fitting the decay λm Pi of the Pauli expectation value ⟨Pi⟩. Hard cycle operations will generally act non-trivially on Pauli operators, meaning that each source of noise is also affected by the hard cycles H that follow it. A Pauli error Pi before a hard cycle H would be entirely indistinguishable from an error H(Pi) occurring after the hard cycle, as shown in Fig. 2. The hard cycles we use in this work are elements of the Clifford group, meaning that H(Pi) = Pj ∈Pn and that Hr = I is the identity channel for finite r since the Clifford group is finite. Hence there is a finite set of distinct Pauli eigenvalues that affect the decay of a given Pauli expectation value, rather than just one. To capture this relation, we define the orbit P ⟳H under the action of H for each Pauli P, as follows [15]:",

      "In this section, we propose an experimental implementa- tion of our HD protocol using path-encoded qudits. In this scheme, we exploit d2 identical type-0 χ(2) crystals to generate an upconverted photon for each possible combi- nation of input paths. Stated differently, for each pair of paths associated to the two input photons, there exists only one triggered crystal. As a consequence, by per- forming a measurement of the output photons paths, it is possible to implement the analogous of a HDBSM. For the sake of simplicity, let us now stick to the qutrit case (d = 3). The details of the setup are shown in Fig.2. Our goal is to teleport an unknown quantum state ρA1. Such state is given by a photon at a frequency ν1 that stores information on three different paths. An entan- gled pair of photons, ρA2B, is generated through SPDC process [49]. Here a 532 nm laser pumps a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) nonlinear crystal, quasi- phasematched to generate an entangled photon pair at ν2 = 1560 nm (|ϕA2⟩) and ν3 = 807 nm (|ϕB⟩) [49]. The frequency of the unknown quantum state |ϕA1⟩, namely ν1, must be different from the one of the signal A2. This is a crucial assumption to distinguish the photons at the exit of a given set of crystals, whenever the SFG process is not triggered. Following the experimental implemen- tation of a SFG with two single photons [49, 50], we set ν1 = 1551 nm. To trigger the type-0 crystal, the two photons A1 and A2 must also have the same polariza- tion. The paths of the input photons of our measurement scheme enter the crystals according to the rules given in Eq.(9). For qutrits, the set of crystal transformations read",
      "Figure 2. Nonlinear optical measurement for quantum teleportation of a qutrit: the two qutrits A1, A2 owned by Alice are path-encoded photons. A1 represents the qutrit to be teleported, while A2 comes from an entangled pair shared by Alice and Bob. Each pair of paths enters a set of type-0 χ(2) crystals according to Eq.(9). If the upconversion takes place, the resulting photon will be reflected by the first set of dichroic mirrors (yellow). On the other hand, if the conversion does not happen, a second set of dichroic mirrors (purple) redistributes the photons into the other groups of crystals. Once the SFG process is triggered, the new photon C is in one of the three paths and undergoes a QFT3 transformation that mixes its modes. Finally, a set of three SPDs detects the photon into one of the possible paths. Alice then broadcasts the information about the measured path and the set of triggered crystals to Bob, who conditionally applies a unitary 3D-Weyl transformation to recover the initial superposition into its qutrit B (see Eq.(15))."

      "now, required to run QPINNs (see Section II and Figure 1). Indeed, this device provides a rigid mesh of reconfig- urable interferometers and a source of TMSV states as inputs. Nonetheless, we can interpret X8 as a QPINN layer, therefore the characterization of this device can provide a realistic model for the losses. To apply such a model, we add to our layer a sequence of gates in- troducing an attenuation factor, whose values follow our experiments. In Figure 8, we propose this model of noisy layer, where, compared to the ideal layer, see Figure 1c, we introduce an amount of optical losses per channel due to the ˆ L(Ti) gate, already introduced in Equation (30), as the last step of the layer. We characterize the attenuation factor Ti by sampling the number of photons on each channel i = 1, ..., 8 and comparing the mean average of counts ⟨ni⟩to the ideal distribution. Therefore, by plugging the values of ⟨ni⟩ in Equation (34), we achieve the final value of each Ti. All the experiments are run by tuning r = 1, and the interferometers on null values (i.e. acting as the identity). The outcome of our experiments is reported in Figure 9. For each channel, we have counted the average ⟨n⟩m, number of measured photons on the detector, compared to the ideal value ⟨n⟩ideal = sinh2(1) ≃1.38. The total amount of shots is equal to 30000. We then obtain the value of Ti for each channel i by employing Equation (34). Moreover, we compare the ideal probability distribution of photon counting, computed by a classical emulation, to the data gathered from our experiments.",
      "Even though NISQ devices are still immature to per- form proper error mitigation techniques, VQ algorithms prove to be resilient, leveraging on backpropagation and parameter updating to contrast noise effects, Figure 8 [79, 80]. Such a strategy proves to be effective mostly when dealing with systemic errors rather than stochastic ones, since the formers can be predicted and mitigated with better accuracy. Therefore, in the first case, adap- tive algorithms, such as QPINNs, can learn the error and counterbalance it. Optical losses are subsumed in this class of systemic noise, as highlighted in the characterization of X8 pro- cessor both from ref. [65] and our experiments. Such a hypothesis is verified in Figure 9, where the variance on the photon count per mode is bounded in a small range. Since the channel attenuation Ti can be derived from the photon count, as stated in Equation (34), these values can be estimated with good accuracy when simulating QPINNs on classical computers. To account such a noise effect, each time the noise is introduced in the QPINN layer as in Figure 8, we sample the attenuation Ti from the distribution obtained by the experimental data from X8, see Figure 9. When tackling the Poisson 1D equa- tion, since two qumode suffice, we choose to sample Ta and Tb from the channels with higher average values of",

      "From the above definition of the Gauss’ law operators, we see that all physical states are eigenstates of G2 with eigenvalue 0. Furthermore, all the other eigenstates will be unphysical and with eigenvalues greater than 0, since G2 is positive definite by construction. It is this spectrum of G2 that we will exploit when using rodeo projections: instead of constructing some eigenstate of a given Hamil- tonian, we will construct a physical state by constructing a ground state of G2 via rodeo projections. This means replacing Hobj in Fig. 1 with G2; furthermore, as the eigenvalue of the desired eigenstate (ie a physical state) is 0, we will remove the phase shift gates, since the re- quired phase shift is 0 ∗t = 0. This is the core of the method outlined in this pa- per: a rodeo projection with this G2 operator will leave all physical amplitudes untouched while suppressing all unphysical amplitudes. Doing this projection frequently enough will keep the system in a close approximation of a gauge invariant state via the Zeno effect. There is one minor detail that we must clarify before moving on. The effectiveness of this projection is helped if the spectrum of the operator, in our case G2, is dis- crete. That way there will be less contamination from the eigenstates nearest to the target eigenstate. Luck- ily, the spectrum of G2 for our principal case of inter- est SU(3) gauge theories, is in fact discrete. This can be seen very straightforwardly using basic quantum me- chanics, though We will point out one small detail: the basic argument implicitly relies on the fact that all states have non-negative norms. While this is obviously true for physical states it is not necessarily true for the full Hilbert space of QCD. However, we are working within a Hamil- tonian formulation and using the temporal gauge, which is a ghostless gauge [66], meaning that we do in fact have non-negative norms for all states. Thus, all components Ga have discrete spectra, so G2 has a discrete spectrum as well. This means the ground state of G2 is gapped, which is helpful when it comes to projection.",
      "for all physical states. This Gtot operator serves the same purpose as the G2 operator: every physical state is an eigenstate with the same eigenvalue (4 for Gtot and 0 for G2) and all unphysical states have different eigenvalues. Thus, Gtot will function the same in our algorithm for our discrete group as G2 will for compact Lie gauge groups. Here, we must highlight the second alteration needed for our discrete group. Figure 1 shows phase rotation gates as part of the circuit diagram, but we argued that they are not required in our algorithm in section IIA due to physical states having an eigenvalue of 0. As just dis- cussed, this is not true for our toy model, so we must include the phase rotation gates with E = 4, the eigen- value of physical states for our system. Now, our aim is to study gauge drift, so we include in our toy model an artificial gauge drift operator D with each time step. We base our constructed gauge drift op- erators off of eq. (12); specifically, we connect each of the, in our case 32, physical states of the system to a randomly selected unphysical state in exactly the way laid out in eq. (12). All other states are unchanged. This provides a way for the system to drift out of the physical subspace of its Hilbert space in a unitary way, and a parameter, ϵ, to control the strength of this drift.

Thus, going forward, we will refer to rodeo projections as any projection of the form expressed in Fig. 1 with some her- mitian operator in place of the Hamiltonian. Recall that our goal is to use frequent projections onto the physical subspace to maintain gauge invariance of the system via the Zeno effect. With this in mind, we now discuss the form of a rodeo projection that we will use to project onto the physical subspace. We replace the Hamiltonian with a new hermitian operator that we will call G2:",
      "The rodeo algorithm aims to construct, to good ap- proximation, an eigenstate of a system with a cho- sen energy by ”shaking off” amplitudes of other, un- wanted eigenstates, like a bull shaking off its rider at a rodeo. The algorithm accomplishes this task with an- cillary qubits as shown in the circuit diagram of Fig. 1. To see how the rodeo algorithm constructs the desired eigenstate, we will write out how it works for one ancil- lary qubit. Starting with the system in the initial state |ψI⟩and the ancillary qubit initialized to |1⟩, we have \" I √",
      "With a circuit diagram of Fig. 1 plus the small alter- ations discussed in section IIA in hand, there remain two main questions when it comes to the implementation of our version of rodeo projections: how should the time parameters, call them tr, be chosen, and how many an- cillary qubits per projection are required?",

      "with Mn(ω) = βn(ω + nΩ/2). W(t, ω) is indeed real since βn(ω) = βn(nΩ−ω) = β−n(−ω)∗. We discuss later its link with the electronic Wigner function, another quantity that has been shown to be a key concept to perform tomography of quantum signals[5, 6, 15, 16]. Experiment. The experiment, presented in Fig.1, is conceptually very simple: the sample, a tunnel junc- tion of dc resistance 40Ω, is ac+dc biased through a mi- crowave coupler and bias tee; the noise it generates is amplified, digitized and recorded. From the time traces we calculate the correlators Sϕ(τ). The ac excitation is at frequency f0 = 4GHz and the digitization takes place at a pace of 32GS/s, so we have access to 8 points per cycle, i.e. 8 values of ϕ (or a time resolution of 31.25ps). For each ϕ the current-current correlator is computed on the fly for 128 values of τ, i.e. from -2 to +2ns, which is much greater than the decay time of the cor- relations [17]. It is then averaged over many repetitions. Since the data averaging takes days, it is crucial to en- sure that the digitization clock and the excitation of the sample remain phase-locked over very long periods. To achieve this we regularly measure the phase of the 4GHz excitation that is reflected on the sample and digitized together with the sample noise. The phase drift is cal- culated then corrected by a motorized mechanical phase shifter on the excitation line. This ensures a phase varia- tion of less than one degree over weeks. A special care has to be taken in the calibration process. As usual in noise measurements, the power gain and noise temperature of the setup are obtained by applying a large dc voltage on the sample and measuring noise vs. voltage[18]. In this limit the noise of the junction is simply the classical shot noise eVdc/R. But time domain measurements are affected not only by the gain or attenuation of the setup, but also by its phase response. Indeed, noise suscepti-",

For the transduction measurements, the optical pump beam is filtered by a 50-MHz tunable bandpass filter (BPF) to suppress laser phase noise at the ∼5-GHz sidebands of the laser frequency [55]. An amplitude modulator (a-m) is used to generate a probe tone at the optical resonance frequency as needed. The optical pump power is controlled by a variable optical attenuator (VOA) and is sent to the device under test (DUT) at the mixing stage of the dilution refrigerator after an optical circulator (Circ1). A lensed optical fiber mounted on a set of cryogenic x-y-z nanopositioners is used to couple to the optical waveguides on the DUT (Fig. 6).

      "We illustrate this process in Figure 4, where the prop- erties of our greedy approach lead to an equivalent circuit, but with a lower distribution cost. Specifically, suppose that the unitary acting on the target qubit of the control gate (7) (highlighted in blue) is diagonal. In that case, gates (7) and (8) commute and consequently they can be permuted (since the resulting circuit, after permuta- tion, is equivalent to the initial one). After permutation of the gates, gate (8) can be added to the packet P2 to form a larger packet Q2. Assuming further that gate (9) (highlighted in red in Figure 4) is either diagonal or anti- diagonal, the packets P3 and P5 can be merged to create the larger packet Q2. In the remainder of this section, we provide further ar- guments justifying the relevance of our approach. For a given circuit C, there is a gate packing sequence Ωmin which minimizes the distribution cost of the circuit. How- ever, in the class of circuits equivalent to C, there may be circuits that have gate packing sequences with dis- tribution cost lower than D(Ωmin). One can naturally",

Since in all cases the encoding consisted of single-qubit Pauli rotations, which were repeated thrice throughout the cir- cuit, it would be expected that all circuits share the same spec- trum Ω= {−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3}×5. However, as can be seen from Fig. 4, the different variational parts of the circuit each constrain different sets of coefficients to zero, therefore remov- ing the corresponding frequency from the spectrum. In some cases the reason for these constraints is obvious, e.g. circuit 0 does not contain any entangling gates. Therefore most of the circuit lies outside the light cone of the local Z3 observ- able and therefore cannot contribute to the spectrum (also cf. Fig. 2). However, the missing frequencies cannot be explained by the heuristics depicted in Fig. 2 for any other cases. The sizes of the spectra range from seven up to 6125 fre- quencies. Furthermore there is no trivial order of inclusion among them. This fact underpins the point that even for prac- tically relevant circuits, the spectrum cannot be determined by the encoding alone.",

(3) the Fourier spectrum of this circuit is given by Ω= {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2} × {−1, 0, 1}. However, there are two effects that eliminate frequencies from the spectrum which are ignored by Eq. (3). Firstly, the x2- rotation gate is outside the light cone of the measurement and can therefore not affect the outcome. And secondly, the two x1-rotation gates combine into a single rotation around the same axis with angle 2x1 [19]. Therefore the output of this VQC is going to be ⟨Z⟩= sin(2x1), which has the Fourier spectrum Ω= {−2, 2} × {0}.",

As a consequence, the functional dependence of the Fourier coefficients cω(θ) on the variational parameters θ has been largely unexplored. This leads to a problem however: The spectrum computed from Eq.

Since the dimension of the MNIST dataset is too large to encode the data into a VQC di- rectly, we instead perform dimensionality reduction via t-SNE [38] and map the dataset into a 2D space beforehand. We train a set of eleven different architectures on these datasets. The quantum circuits consist of one of the variational layers depicted in Fig. 3, which is repeated three times. The expressivity and entangling capability of these varaitional lay- ers has been previously studied in [35]. Each entangling layer is preceded by single-qubit Pauli X or Y rotation gates which encode the classical input data. The encoding rotation axis is always chosen to be different from the first rotation gates of the variational layer to avoid successive rotations around the same axis. Finally, the expectation value of the resulting quantum state with respect to the Z3 observable constitutes the output of the model. Next, we train these VQCs on the above mentioned datasets with 5000 samples for 100 epochs with a batch size of 128 us- ing the Adam optimizer [39] with a learning rate of 0.005 and mean squared error (MSE) loss function. Their performances are continuously validated on 500 samples of unseen test data during the training. The gradients of the VQC are evaluated using the parameter shift rule [40]. As we are not interested on the absolute performance of each architecture but rather how they perform in relation to each other, we abstain from hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we rank the set of VQCs for these datasets ac- cording to Section IV-B. However, the Mahalanobis distance is only evaluated for a randomly selected subset of 100 co- efficients, since calculating the full covariance matrix is too expensive. The results of these experiments are discussed in the fol- lowing section.",

The number of frequencies contained in the intersection is indicated by the width of the respective column and explicitly given by the number in the bottommost cell. The numbers are only shown in the larger cells for readability. For example, in the column with the label 1822 only the blue row is colored. This means that the spectrum of architecture six contains 1822 frequencies, which are not present in any other spectrum. The rightmost column with the label 1090 indicates that there are 1090 frequencies unique to the architectures one, four and five and so on. The spectra belonging to architectures zero, three, eight and ten only contain seven frequencies and therefore ap- pear to be empty on this scale.

      "2 ≈0.29: noise is crucial in the distillation of entanglement. In what follows, we incorporate the protocol for purifying noisy measurements to the distillation of entanglement, see Fig. 2. The goal is primarily to improve a lower bound of an initial fidelity, denoted by F > L, such that a resulting fidelity increases F ′ > F. That is, L = 1/2 for noiseless LOCC and L > 1/2 for noisy LOCC with a depolarization noise on measurements [24], and we aim to maintain L = 1/2 even if LOCC are noisy. As a byproduct, the improvement also allows us to optimize the resources for entanglement distillation. For generality, we do not restrict to measurements with a depolarization noise in Eq. (3), considered in Ref. [24]. We begin with measurements containing general noise in Eq. (10) and seek a lower bound L(n,m) with n −1 and m −1 target qubits of Alice and Bob, respectively, for purification of noisy measurements. We now remark that noisy measurements with a depolarization noise in Eq. (3), that is, particular instances with t = 0 in Eq. (10), lead to the worst-case scenario. To be precise, let us suppose that an error rate s is given in a noisy",
      "FIG. 2: The protocol for distilling entanglement works with a pair of isotropic states ρ⊗2 F distributed to Alice and Bob, see Eq. (13). Then, each party applies a CNOT gate and performs a measurement on a qubit in the second register. A resulting state in the first register is accepted only when the measurement outcomes are identical. Then, an ebit can be distilled whenever F > 1/2. When measurements in the second register are noisy, an ebit can be distilled for a limited range F > L for some lower bound L > 1/2. Then, two parties apply error-suppressing detectors and recover a lower bound L sufficiently close to 1/2. For an error rate up to 5%, one additional qubit on each party immediately allows entanglement distillation for an initial singlet fraction up to F > 0.505.",
      "Let us follow the steps for copies of isotropic states, see also Fig. 2. i) Two parties take two copies ρA1B1 F ⊗ρA2B2 F , and apply bilateral CNOT gates, VA1A2 2 and VB1B2 2 , see Eq. (4). ii) Two parties perform measurements in the second register A2B2 in the computational basis {M0, M1}. iii) If outcomes are equal, a state remaining in the first register A1B1 is accepted. Otherwise, they abort the protocol and start step i) with isotropic states. Once states are accepted, two parties resume the protocol with accepted copies from the state twirling. Suppose that measurement outcomes in the second register are identical and the copy in the first register is accepted. The singlet fidelity of the accepted state is given by"

      "can be naturally constructed in the MPS representation of the encoding-decoding circuit. We encode a (dx+1)×dy surface code4, then treat the first dx × dy qubits (leaving out the last column) as if they formed a surface code patch. We apply coherent errors on this dx × dy surface code, decode it, and measure out the corresponding log- ical qubit (See Fig. 8(a)). The remaining column of dy qubits retains some syndrome information from the larger [(dx+1)×dy] surface code, and thus can remain entangled with the reference qubit (See Fig. 5(b)). This circuit is closely related to the first dx time steps in the (1 + 1)D monitored circuit. It differs only by the application of a repetition code decoder and a logical measurement; these are artificial extra operations that do not alter the phase transition (See Appendix C) but have the advantage of offering an analytical understanding of the connection be- tween unitary design phase transition and entanglement phase transition (See Section V D). This construction allows us to study the purification of the reference qubit as we sweep across the staircase along one direction—here we choose the horizontal (x) direction. Setting dy = d and viewing dx as a variable time scale, the averaged entropy of the reference qubit takes the form SR(dx) ∼exp(−dx/τ). In Fig. 7, we show a finite-size scaling analysis of τ/d for model considered in Section IV, obtained from the MPS simulation of the spacewise dynamics up to dx = 3d (only d ≤dx ≤3d are used in the fit to avoid early-time transient effects). The existence of a finite-size crossing point of τ/d in Fig. 7(a) indicates z = 1 (τ ∝d1 at crit- icality). Therefore, we can locate the critical point pc and correlation length exponent length ν by using a sim- ilar scaling ansatz in Eq. 24. From the data collapse in Fig. 7(b), we have pc = 0.88(1) and ν = 1.3(2), which co- incide with the critical point of the unitary design phase transition within tolerance. This indicates the a deeper connection between the unitary design phase transition and the entanglement phase transition.",
      "lence between space and time in the presence of mea- surements [44, 64–67] to trade a space dimension for a time dimension (see Fig. 5(b)). The idea is similar to the space-evolving block decimation method for sampling 2D shallow circuits [46, 48], see Sec. II C. As a result of this mapping we have an effective 1D de- scription of the problem, which paves the way for matrix product state (MPS) algorithms. The relevant MPS has N = 3d qubits (corresponding to a 3 × d strip of qubits, with the factor of 3 coming from the geometry of the past lightcone in Fig. 5(b)). See bottom panel of Fig. 6 for an explicit example for d = 5 surface code. Notably, the final (syndrome) measurements are converted to midcircuit measurements and resets in the dynamics of the MPS. This is especially interesting since mid-circuit measure- ments can lower the state’s entanglement entropy and even drive a transition to an area-law-entangled phase (see Sec. II C). The accuracy of the MPS representation relies on the entanglement area law [68]. Similar to the random circuit sampling problem stud- ied in Ref. [46, 48], the unitary gates comprising encoder E, “coherent errors” U, and decoder D are competing with the syndrome measurements; this raises the pos- sibility of an entanglement phase transition. Since the number of measurements is fixed by the circuit’s geome- try, the competition is driven by the strength of coherent errors—the same parameter that, as we saw, drives the unitary design and error correction transition. It is nat- ural to conjecture an entanglement phase transition in this problem, and thus a complexity transition for the associated classical algorithm, at the same threshold pc of coherent errors. In the following we investigate this question both numerically and analytically.",
      "for arbitrary on-site unitaries as well as a wide class of many-body unitaries. In such cases the mapping to free Majorana fermions breaks down, and a new approach is needed. Our algorithm is based on the “staircase” circuit rep- resentation of the encoder (decoder) of surface codes. Surface code states possess long-range (topological) en- tanglement, and so cannot be prepared by shallow lo- cal unitary circuits. Staircase circuits sequentially apply gates across the system, building up the long-range en- tanglement step by step, and achieve the optimal linear circuit depth lower bound [59, 60]. While in practice measurement-based circuits may have an advantage for preparing surface code states [61, 62], at the level of clas- sical simulation it will prove useful to focus on staircase encoder circuits. Similarly, staircase decoder circuits can be used to turn the two- and four-qubit measurements of surface code stabilizers into single-qubit measurements. The sequential nature of staircase encoder/decoder cir- cuits, combined with the repeated measurement of in- dividual qubits, allows us to effectively trade a space di- mension for a time dimension. This turns the 2D problem with final measurements into a (1 + 1)D dynamics with mid-circuit measurements, Fig. 5. This general strategy is briefly reviewed in Sec. II C and is the basis of a simu- lation algorithm called ‘space-evolving block decimation’ (SEBD) [46, 48].",

      "entangle every pair of adjacent qubits, where the last qubit is entangled with the first. a) Measurement Layer: This is the final stage of the circuit, where quantum states collapse into classical values. We use the expectation value of the Pauli Z operator as the output of the model. Usually, in VQCs, the variational layer (Ansatz) is repeated multiple times within a circuit to increase the model’s ex- pressive power. In this work, we employ a technique called SuDaI [17], where the authors not only repeat the Ansatz but also the input layer. In each new input layer, the successive timestamps are injected allowing the model to process tempo- ral dependencies more effectively. In [17], the successive data injection technique is applied to a univariate time series. In the work, we extend this approach by adapting it to a multivariate time series. In this work, since we use a QGAN, we use two VQC, one for the generator and one for the discriminator. The generator circuit uses four qubits, while the discriminator uses six qubits. For the former, the first two qubits represent the first feature, a1, of the time series. The last two qubits encode the second feature, b1, following the same pattern. A series of variational circuits follows after encoding. We alternate between an input layer and a variational layer three times. In each iteration i, we encode ai, the next timestamp, (respectively bi for 3rd and 4th qubit). For the discriminator, we follow the same approach but introduce a fifth and sixth qubits, where we encode the predicted/real timestamp. Instead of using SuDaI, we employ data re-uploading [18] for these additional qubits. Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the discriminator.",

This tripartite configu- ration provides the minimal and general framework for analyzing entanglement transfer using the formalism of quantum channels, which capture how entanglement is redistributed between subsystems. Two systems suffice to generate or destroy entanglement; three systems are required to meaningfully track its redistribution. We take the Hilbert space of these systems to be finite- dimensional, which is justified as long as the systems pos- sess finite size and a finite energy budget. Systems ˜ A and A are assumed to be initially entangled. During the sub- sequent unitary time evolution, systems A and B interact adiabatically while system ˜ A remains a non-interacting ancilla, as illustrated in Figure 1. This setup allows us to analyze how the interaction generates entanglement between A and B, and also how ˜ A, which was initially entangled with A, can become entangled with system B and/or with system AB. To this end, we will consider a quantum channel from A to A′ and the complementary channel from A to B′, which together formalize how en- tanglement is redistributed during the evolution. We will",

We assume here that system A is initially prepared entangled with an ancillary system ˜ A, such that ˜ A purifies A. The system B is assumed to be initially pure and unentan- gled with both A and ˜ A. Subjected to a time-dependent Hamiltonian as in (17), the composite pure system ˜ AAB then undergoes adiabatic evolution while ˜ A remains in- ert.

In the second method, heterodyne detection, both quadratures are simultaneously measured and, therefore, can be modelled as a dual homodyne detection, see Figure 1. In this scheme, the detection uses a 90-degree optical hybrid that splits the incoming quantum signal and LO equally.

      "For the third condition, we need to introduce the concept of even and odd segment. A segment is a set of voxels connected within the same XY plane in the 3D routing. We classify all segments into even or odd as follows. First, we select a specific leaf as a pivot leaf, and the segment connected to it is designated as an even segment. If Condition 2 is satisfied, each ancillary cell connects exactly two segments. If segments are connected to an even (odd) segment without a kink via an ancillary cell, they are labeled as an even (odd) segment. If segments are connected to an even (odd) segment with a kink via an ancillary cell, they are labeled as an odd (even) segment. Repeating this classification, all segments are labeled as either even or odd. Then, the third and fourth conditions can be stated as follows. Condition 3 (No-leaf-in-odd-segment): No leaf is included in odd-segment. Condition 4 (No-fork-in-odd-segment): No fork voxel is included in odd-segment. Note that one might worry that these conditions depend on the choice of the pivot leaf. However, if Condition 3 is satisfied for one choice of pivot, it remains satisfied for any other pivot choice. Therefore, the pivot leaf can be chosen arbitrarily. Figure 17(a) shows an example of how a 3D routing that satisfies the above four con- ditions can be decomposed into even and odd segments. Here, diagonally hatched green voxels correspond to leaves (i.e., data cells), blue voxels are even segments, vertically",
      "We reduce an ancillary cell connected by two even segments into a single even segment, using the circuit equivalence shown in Fig. 18(a). Similarly, an ancillary cell connected by two odd segments is reduced to a single odd segment. This procedure is repeated until every ancillary cell bridges two segments of different parities. Next, we reduce a sequence consisting of an even segment, an ancillary cell, an odd segment, another ancillary cell, and an even segment into a single even segment using the circuit equivalence shown in Figs. 18(b), 18(c), 18(d). This procedure is repeated until no ancillary cells or odd segments remain. Eventually, a single even segment connects all the leaves of the original tree, which corresponds to the target many-body Pauli measurement. Figure 17(b) shows the corresponding quantum circuits to Fig. 17(a). By repeating the replacement according to Fig. 18, we can convert it to five-body Z measurements.",
      "Thus, if all the data cells (i.e., leaves) in Fig. 17(a) are connected via Z-boundaries, this 3D routing can be mapped to a five-body Pauli-Z measurement. The following subsections will show the proof of the above theorem. Note that if we want to perform lattice surgery in which the Pauli operator contains both X and Z, we can perform it by adjusting the position of the surface-code lattice in advance. This requires the ability to shift or rotate the shape of surface codes and to perform stabilizer Pauli measurements that involve both X and Z [8, 18, 37], which would incur additional latency in scheduling.",

      "approach where the channel is dilated into a variational unitary circuit with ancillas [64]: We introduce an an- cilla qubit between each nearest-neighbor pair of system qubits and construct a ladder-shaped variational quan- tum circuit. This circuit structure is first proposed as a quantum realization of the matrix product state [65– 72], and is illustrated in Fig. 1b. The ladder structure is more expressive than brick-wall structure when compar- ing circuits with the same gate count, as noted in recent works [73, 74]. For Quantinuum H1 processor’s architec- ture, the main error source comes from entangling gates, this reduced gate count makes the sequential circuit more favorable (see SM for more details). In order to benchmark the performance of variational decoding, we choose three small physical system sizes, L = 3, 4, 5 with noise strength p = 0.5 and optimize the variational circuit up to τ = 17 layers. The result is shown in Fig. 4, where two observations can be made. (1) To begin with, comparing the L = 5 to L = 3, 4, the variational decoder saturates to a larger Fe in the pres- ence of Z dephasing, whereas the saturation Fe decreases for X dephasing, matching our theoretical prediction. (2) The decoder performance for X-noise nearly saturates at τ = 5 for all three sizes, whereas for the Z-dephasing, the saturation depths grow substantially with L, which are 5, 7, 11 for L = 3, 4, 5, respectively. In the experiment, we fix L = 4, 8 and d = 1 and set the error rate to be p ∝L−1/2. This noise rate is correctable for Z dephasing but not for X dephasing. Even at de- coding circuit depth 1, the output fidelity already reveals the difference between the mixed-state phases induced by the two quantum channels: In Fig. 5, for Z dephasing,",

      "This last case is the most unusual and interesting. It is the X-Ising variant on lattices without triangular mo- tifs. The ground state here turns out to be an Ising ordered/disordered state for the on-chain spins coexist- ing with a very short-ranged liquid-like (classical) para- magnetic state for the off-chain spins! In other words, all the conserved off-chain spin sectors have the same spectrum as indicated in Fig. 2. This arises due to an additional structure present in this case that was absent in the previous cases. The structure is the presence of additional extensively large conserved quantities apart from the off-chain spins that are mutually anticommuting when there is a shared site. General consequences of this structure form the subject of Ref. [28]. The additional conserved quantities are products of three X-component operators from sites on each of the Z-Ising segments (or- ange solid lines in Fig. 2), i.e. Sx i Sx j Sx k where {i, j, k} forms a Z-Ising segment JZ-I \u0000 Sz i Sz j + Sz j Sz k \u0001 that is dis- connected from other Z-Ising segments. Since there are an extensive number of these operators coming from all the Ising segments, this leads to the extensive degeneracy associated with the off-chain spin configurations. The ex- tensive scaling with system size of these additional con- served quantities can depend on the model, i.e. here they scale as L2 same as the conserved off-chain spins. There can be variants where they scale as L for example [29]. This should not be thought of as violating the third law of thermodynamics [30], but rather is well-understood as capturing the relevant physics of real systems operat- ing at the relevant temperature scales in a physical set- ting or experiment [31] similar to classical spin ices [32]. In presence of other (even smaller) couplings, a natural guess is to presume the existence of a (possibly gapless) “slow” mode primarily composed of the off-chain spins as excitations on top of the ground state, apart from the gapped Majorana excitations from the on-chain spins",
      "Given the above massively degenerate ground state manifold, one now expects a two-step entropy release similar to that in the Kitaev spin liquids in presence of thermal fluctuations [35, 36] with residual entropy effects as temperature goes to zero. The first step would corre- spond to the entropy release due to the off-chain spins and the second step to the on-chain spins. The relative magnitude of the two steps will depend on the ratio of the number of off-chain spins to on-chain spins with it being 1:2 for the lattice geometry in this case (Fig. 2). Thus these states can be considered as simpler variants of the Kitaev spin liquid. As differences, the conserved off-chain spins are geometrically independent and site- local in our constructions, whereas in the Kitaev model, the conserved plaquette operators are “interlocked” with common sites. The excitations also have a stripy nature in all of the above models, whereas the Majorana excita- tions in the Kitaev spin liquid are fully two-dimensional in nature. One can have non-stripy constructions as well with localized excitations throughout as shown Fig. 7.",
      "which will be higher in energy compared to the presumed slow mode. The solvable limit can be said to have an ex- tensive number of zero modes from the perspective of this expectation. The above structure also implies that the absence of triangular motifs is not an absolute require- ment for this physics; rather one only requires Z-Ising (closed or open) segments with at least one conserved spin in the spirit of the above constructions connected through solely X-Ising (or solely YY-Ising) segments as shown in Fig. 7. Also must be mentioned before proceed- ing further, that the results discussed above pertaining to the particular chain-based construction of Fig. 2 is essen- tially a rediscovery and restatement of the result found in Ref. [33]. The authors of Ref. [33] arrived at them with different motivations coming from orbital physics in transition metal systems and did not discuss explicitly the classical spin liquid aspect of the off-chain spins as well as the phenomenological consequence analogous to the Kitaev honeycomb model that we describe next.",

III B for further details), paramagnetic ((b); see Sec. III E for further details) arrangement of the conserved off-chain spins with gapped on-chain spinon excitations. The difference in the size of the off-chain spins and on-chain spins in the panel (a) illustrates the following: since off-chain spins are conserved, the Z-moment size is maximal, while the on-chain Z-spins fluctuate due to the XY terms thus leading to a reduced moment size compared to the off-chain spins.",

The JW-spectrum on the chains is gapped implying exponentially decaying transverse XY correla- tions as well. The ground state can also be thought of as a spinless fermion charge density wave. In contrast to the Kitaev model where one takes recourse to Lieb’s theorem [24] to rigorously pin down the ground state sec- tor, here we are not aware of any rigorous way of proving the ground state sector selection.

The model construction will consist of collection of spin chains with on-chain kinetic terms and off-chain spins that are restricted to have (“interaction”) Z-Ising couplings with the on-chain spins. For such a bond-dependent scenario, the JW-transformation can be used fruitfully and gauge artifacts of the above sort are removed by a judicious “snake-like” choice for the JW- string (Fig 2 (a)).

      "ing to the simple weight-4 stabilizer constructions con- sidered in this work, it is possible to explicitly specify a complete syndrome extraction circuit, as illustrated in Fig.1(b), which will be of the same depth as a surface code. To emphasize the subtlety of constructing effi- cient syndrome extraction procedures, we show in Fig.2 a concrete example that highlights the issue. Specifically, we consider a single Z-type auxiliary qubit and its four neighboring data qubits, along with two X-type auxiliary qubits coupled to the same data qubits. If one selects an arbitrary ordering of the entangling gates, such as the sequence shown in panel (a), the circuit may inadver- tently create an entangled state involving the auxiliary qubits. In this situation, the measurement outcomes of the X- and Z-type stabilizers are no longer statistically independent, which can compromise fault tolerance. This effect can be understood more precisely in two complementary ways. From a connectivity perspective, as depicted in Fig. 1(a), each auxiliary qubit is coupled to exactly two left data qubits and two right data qubits. Concretely, if the Z-type auxiliary qubit first interacts with the two left-type data qubits before any entangling operations between those data qubits and the X-type auxiliary qubits have occurred, then subsequent interac- tions with the right-type data qubits propagate entan- glement across the auxiliary qubits. Equivalently, this can be formulated in terms of the commutation relations between the controlled gates implementing the stabilizer measurements. Ideally, the sequence of entangling opera- tions should correspond to a set of controlled-Pauli gates whose collective action commutes pairwise between X- and Z-type stabilizers. In particular, if the gates corre- sponding to the X- and Z-type stabilizers fail to com- mute, the result is an effective entangling operation be- tween auxiliary qubits. This entanglement is manifested in the measurement statistics as nontrivial commutators between the extracted stabilizer observables, thereby vi- olating the requirement that the syndrome bits are inde- pendent random variables conditioned only on the data qubit errors. Note that the issue discussed here is un- related to hook error [49] which will depend on how the logical operators are defined as well. In this work, we verify that our error extraction circuits are fault tolerant by validating the performance of the decoded error rate. In contrast, Fig. 2(b) shows an ordering of the entan- gling gates that avoids the problem described above. In this circuit, the Z-type auxiliary qubit interacts with its left-type data qubits both at the beginning and at the end of the gate sequence. In terms of operator order- ing, this arrangement preserves the commutation of the effective stabilizer measurement operators, because each data qubit interaction is bracketed in a way that prevents the controlled gates from generating unwanted commu- tators when conjugated through the rest of the circuit. It is straightforward to find such compatible gate order- ings for the code presented here because the weight-4 stabilizers decompose naturally into two left-type data qubits and two right-type data qubits. This partition-",
      "FIG. 2. (a) If the error extraction circuit is not constructed correctly, the circuit will create an entangled state between the Z and X stabilizer auxiliary qubits mediated by the red gates. (b) In a good circuit, the entangling gates commute fully and disentangle the auxiliary qubits from each other through the green gates. Thus, the effictive stabilizer mea- surements fully commute."

The Hamiltonian Eq. (4) has the chiral symmetry σy ˆ H(kx, ky)σ−1 y = −ˆ H(kx, ky). Therefore the eigenstates are pinned onto a circle defined as the intersection of the ⟨σx⟩–⟨σz⟩plane with the Bloch sphere. When traced along a closed loop in the Brillouin zone, an eigenstate thus traces out a trajectory that winds around the origin of the Bloch sphere for an integer number of times. If such a closed loop in the Brillouin zone encircles a Dirac point, the winding of the trajectory can be associated with the topological charge of the Dirac point [44, 45]. An eigenstate trajectory completing a single winding in the counter-clockwise (clockwise) direction indicates that the Dirac point enclosed in the interior of the loop has topological charge +1 (−1). The sampling line of our interest, Lφ : ky = Mkx + φ (mod 2π), forms a non-contractible loop that cannot be characterized by an “interior” and an “exterior.” In this case, the Dirac point is manifested by the change in the eigenstate trajectory as the sampling line moves across the Dirac point, as illustrated in Fig. 6. In Hamiltonian Eq. (4), the Dirac points at Γ, M and those at X are of opposite charges. The loop Lφ=π/2 crosses two Dirac points of the same charge as it is moved to Lφ=−π/2.

      "This formulation is inconsistent with the standard defini- tion of the DLA as found in Refs. [2, 3], where the DLA is defined as the Lie closure of the algebra generated by parameterized gates only. But In their analysis, only pa- rameterized gates are explicitly defined. Therefore, when the circuit includes unparameterized(fixed) gates, we ar- gue that it is inappropriate to simply represent them as Hamiltonian evolutions and treat their generators as el- ements of the Lie closure. Instead, their effect on the parameterized gates should be carefully considered. We have an example to demonstrate this point.As de- picted in Fig. 1, the ZZ-rotation operator admits a de- composition utilizing CNOT and Z-rotation operators. For the purpose of computing the DLA, the generator corresponding to the CNOT gate is included as a basis element. Explicitly, we have",

      "After X cutting and qubit removal, we obtain a de- formed code capable of realizing the target logical mea- surement. Since the target X logical operator is a prod- uct of stabilizers in the deformed code (due to the ex- istence of the measurement channel), its eigenvalue can be read out through stabilizer measurements in the code surgery circuit. Meanwhile, other X logical operators re- main unmeasured, as their corresponding channels have been closed. Pseudocode describing the algorithm for X cutting and generating this deformed code is provided in Appendix B. Logical operator painting. Finally, we address Z logical operators during the measurement of an X logical operator. All Z logical operators that commute with the measured X operator must remain preserved through- out the code surgery circuit in Fig. 3(a). Consider such a commuting Z logical operator, represented by an n- dimensional row vector jZ. Its preservation proceeds as follows. First, after initializing qubits of the ancilla system in the |0⟩state, any operator of the form ¯ jZ = (jZ + hZ, β) is equivalent to jZ, where hZ ∈rowsp(HZ) denotes an element in the stabilizer group of the origi- nal code and β acts on the qubits initialized in |0⟩. We refer to (hZ, β) as a valid storage of jZ if ¯ jZ is a logi- cal operator of the deformed code. Since ¯ jZ commutes with subsequent deformed-code stabilizer measurements, it remains preserved until the ancilla system is measured out. Finally, we apply the feedback gate V to correct the phase introduced by the storage and restore the original logical operator jZ. We note that the deformed code con- structed in the earlier stages guarantees valid storages for all Z logical operators that commute with the measured X operator. For each commuting Z logical operator, there may ex- ist multiple valid storages, which we will explain shortly. The choice of storage not only determines the form of the feedback gate V but also affects the overall fault toler- ance of the code surgery circuit. Therefore, we need to optimize the storage to ensure the fault tolerance. We now explain the storages of logical operators using the smooth-rough-boundary picture. Since the interme- diate code produced by stretching and Z cutting contains only one rough boundary, it does not support any Z log- ical operators; see Fig. 4(b). The storages for Z logical operators are created by X cutting, which introduces ad- ditional rough boundaries in the code; see Fig. 4(c). Each Z logical operator is then stored along a line terminating at the original fixed rough boundary and one of the newly created ones. These new rough boundaries also introduce gauge qubits, which result in multiple valid storages for a given Z logical operator. For instance, ZI and ZII are both valid storages for a particular Z logical operator, differing by a gauge operator ZIII. These different stor- ages vary in their susceptibility to X errors. For example, ZI and ZII anticommute with XC and XD, respectively, and since XD has higher weight, we prefer ZII as a more fault-tolerant storage for the Z logical operator of the original code.",

      "if q = 2n is the number of qubits used to represent a permutation matrix of dimension n. This is the best we can do with local gates, but not quite close to the total number of permutations n!. The idea is now to enlarge the spanned space by adding extra qubits as in the circuit in Figure 7, with the unitaries that we have constructed in Section 4. With this, we can obtain the following advantages. First, by Eq. (2), we can see that the number of convex combination augments, giving us the hope that adding addition qubits is similar to spanning a much larger space and then projecting it onto our problem space n. This hope is supported by theory (below) and simulation studies. Second, since to compute the optimization cost f(P) will typically involve O(n2) arith- metic operations as well as storage, a unitary in Cn×n is classically simulatable by the same computer. By increasing the number of qubits and choosing m ≫n, then our unitaries will cease to be classically simulatable (even though the cost will remain so) and the algorithm derived upon them will be genuinely quantum. To support the first advantage, we can now prove a useful theoretical result, which characterizes the output ˆ Pθ, whenever U (θ) is a permutation matrix. Specifically, we choose the Bruhat unitary, U Bruhat(θ), and the Borel unitary, U Borel(θ), both obtained in Section 4, and reported in Figure 8, for simplicity.",
      "Consider the variational circuit presented in Figure 7, where U (θ) ∈C2m+n is any arbitrary unitary matrix. The circuit is initialized in the |0⟩state. We have a total of 2 log2(n) + 2m qubits. The first represents the n2 entries of a square matrix, while the additional 2m qubits are ancilla. We measure only the last 2 log2(n) qubits. Mariella and coauthors show in their Lemma 3.1 that, for any U (θ), measuring the last 2 log2(n) qubits one obtains the corresponding entries of a n × n doubly-stochastic matrix. We recall that a doubly-stochastic matrix is a convex combination of permutation matrices. Furthermore, they also show that, if m = 0, then the measurements deliver the entries of the matrix U (θ) ⊙U (θ), where ⊙is the Hadamard entry-wise product and (·) is the complex conjugate operator. In particular, if m = 0 and U (θ) is a permutation matrix, then the output of the circuit is the same permutation matrix. We summarize the results obtained in [20] in the following proposition, for later use.",
      "We can now explore by numerical simulations the total number of unique permutations generated by our quantum circuit (Figure 7) with a few different unitaries U (θ). For comparison, we use the Bruhat unitary, U Bruhat(θ), and the Borel unitary, U Borel(θ), both obtained in Section 4, and reported here in Figure 8. The Borel unitary is explored here since, for some applications, it could be beneficial to have a weaker circuit, spanning less permutations, but in return that requires less classical parameters, and have a shallower depth relatively to the number of parameters. We also use a widely used unitary that has been proposed in the context of quantum machine learning: the Strong Entangling Layer (SEL) unitary [39] as baseline.",

The middle plot presents a comparison between actual and predicted test data for the final year, while the right plot illustrates the error distribution across samples. In this plot, green represents the predicted values, while red/orange indicates the actual test data . The presented result considered the case where only load demand is to be forecasted. Next, the model is tested with a multi-feature input, incorporating both load demand and weather data (temperature in this study). Each feature is encoded onto a different wire in the quantum circuit: load demand feature is encoded on wire 0 while temperature feature is encoded on wire 1. The model is retrained for 50 epochs using the simplifications in Model 2, yielding similar cost results (0.0014888). However, the learning process is notably faster, as observed in the cost error vs. iteration plot. This improvement in training speed is likely due to the correlation between Input 1 and Input 2, where higher temperatures in hot seasons lead to increased demand, and a similar trend is observed during colder weather. The updated parameters after training are (0.08623425, 0.63306879, 0.20919965, 0.55718403, 0.6897581, -0.31122784).

      "A more advanced forecasting scenario involves predicting demand over multiple future time steps, rather than just one step ahead as done in earlier cases. Here, the proposed Model-2 is used to predict demand for two year into the future, using the same training dataset. A function is created to predict future demand using a sliding window approach. This function takes the most recent window-size days of data as input, predicts the demand for the next day using the trained model, adds the predicted value to the window, and removes the oldest value. This process is repeated for the desired number of future days. This method allows the model to generate multi-step forecasts iteratively, where each predicted value is used as input for the next prediction. This is known as closed-loop or recursive prediction. To make the model more robust and better at handling unseen data, random noise is added to the training data, which helps improve its generalization ability. In this experiment, a 3-year input window is chosen to emphasize recent data and seasonal patterns and reducing computational complexity. The sliding window approach is then applied iteratively to generate predictions for each day of the two-year period, with each predicted value becoming part of the input for the next prediction. This problem required extended training time. An early stopping mechanism was implemented, terminating training at epoch 20 out of a possible 50 to optimize performance. The results, shown in Fig. 7, include a blue scatter plot representing the test data from the final year of the dataset, along with the model's corresponding predictions. The model then extends its predictions an additional 365 days into the future (Year 7), successfully capturing the dataset's seasonal patterns. The predicted trend maintains the distinctive \"W\" shape, reflecting the region's four-season cycle. Unlike the method in [29], which only predicts test data (year 6), this model provides a full year of predictions beyond the test range. The proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.3% (171 MW out of 2696 MW), which is better than the 7.99% error reported in [29] using a deep learning approach that is limited to the test dataset and does not extend predictions beyond the six-year mark. This result highlights the effectiveness of the proposed one-layer model, which, despite its simplicity and fewer iterations, performs better than more complex models like LSTM and GRU in accurately capturing the dataset's patterns.",

We now invoke classic edge coloring results for a com- plete graph of Q vertices corresponding to the Q qubits. Specifically, the edges of this graph can be decorated with at most Q different colors so that no incident edges have the same color. In general, edge colorings can be assigned efficiently with O(poly(Q)) runtime [31, 32], but we make use of a very specific construction for the complete graph. Without loss of generality, we assume that Q is even and use the following coloring scheme. We distribute Q− 1 vertices evenly on a circle to create a regular polygon and locate the remaining vertex at the center of the circle, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Then we assign a distinct color to each edge connecting a central-exterior vertex pair (as indicated by dashed lines in Fig. 3), and color the edges perpendicular to the central edge (as solid lines in Fig. 3).

      "unmeasured qubits are kept. This protocol detects X-type errors (X or Y on a single pair); therefore, a successful distillation increases confidence that no X error has occurred. Distillation-(b) is a variant that reverses the direction of the CNOT gates and uses X basis measurements, allowing detection of Z-type error components. Finally, Distillation-(c) [28] incorporates local rotations before the CNOTs, enabling the detection of both X- and Z-type errors simultaneously, though it fails when both errors occur at once (i.e., it cannot detect a Y error). Bell-diagonal states, as defined in(1), are described by three free parameters and thus require three distinct distillation protocols to fully characterize the Bell- diagonal elements. In the special case of a Werner state, which is parameterized by a single variable, it suffices to apply any one of the three distillation protocols shown in Fig. 1. Previous studies have demonstrated that Distimation pro- vides superior resource efficiency compared to QST for Werner and Bell-diagonal states [10]. However, it remains unclear whether Distimation maintains its efficacy under more complex and realistic noise conditions typically observed in actual quantum hardware. The original Disti-Mator frame- work [15] emphasizes that its estimation algorithm can tol- erate gate and measurement noise through a bisection-based approach. However, doing so requires sufficiently large sample sizes to guarantee the desired estimation precision and high success probability, especially under realistic hardware noise. In this work, we employ a more direct “inversion method” for parameter extraction, which uses fewer samples but is more sensitive to gate and measurement errors. Consequently, our experiments produce larger trace distances compared to the ideal bisection-based approach. Investigating how to integrate bisection–or other robust post-processing techniques–under practical and realistic sampling constraints remains an im- portant avenue improve accuracy while preserving efficiency, which we leave for future work. Before proceeding further, we note that for the sake of brevity we will henceforth introduce the verb to distimate meaning to estimate by using distillation, and the process of estimating via distillation will be referred to as distimation.",
      "where the parameter ω quantifies the depolarization level, with ω = 0 indicating a pure maximally entangled state |Φ+⟩, and higher values representing increased isotropic noise. Entanglement distillation [16] is a process that takes two or more Bell pairs of fidelity F0 and probabilistically produces a single Bell pair of fidelity F1 ≥F0. The success probability depends on how noisy the initial Bell pairs are. The main insight behind Disti-Mator is that by estimating the success probability of the distillation process we can estimate the noise parameters. Figure 1 depicts three distillation protocols that were proposed in [15] to estimate Bell-diagonal states in (1). The gates labeled I (in Fig. 1) denote places where Pauli noise is injected into our implementation. In Distillation-(a), each party performs a CNOT on their two qubits and measures the target (second) qubit in the Z basis. The procedure is considered successful if both measurements coincide, and the",

The encoded state evolves through a sequence of parameterized unitaries followed by measurements on each qubit, and the observable expectation values correspond to the predicted probabilities of the respective label. Consequently, the predicted label is given by the qubit index with the highest expected value. 3. The predicted probabilities are compared with the true probabilities obtained from the actual label through the cross-entropy loss function, which quantitatively evaluates the inference performance. 4. The parameters are updated iteratively using the gradient descent method. (b) The detailed circuit design of the variational circuit presented in this paper. The data is encoded into the circuit through amplitude encoding to minimize the requirement for the number of qubits and conserve memory for simulation. The parameterized unitary consists of multiple layers of unitaries, with each layer containing a sequence of single-qubit rotations with parameterized rotation axes and angles, denoted as Rlm as shorthand for Rmnlm(θlm), followed by a sequence of entangling Controlled-Z gates without trainable parameters. An error channel E is added after every ideal gate Rlm, constitutes ˜ Rlm.

Since the noise channel acts on the logical space, p is interpreted as the combined log- ical X, Y , and Z-flip error rate. In practice, the channel would map the density operator after every decomposed gate of Rˆ nlm. However, since any unitary commutes with the depolarizing channel, it is convenient to treat it as in Equation 8. To evaluate the trainability of the variational circuit with only single-qubit noise, we used a learning rate of 0.005 and a total of 15000 images split into 50 images per batch in our training set, and 250 images in our test set, which are drawn and ordered randomly. The ex- pectation values are evaluated on the Pauli-Z operators, and every circuit is executed with 10000 shots to sim- ulate real hardware with non-zero shot noise and avoid potential saddle points [59].

      "Proof. As depicted in Figure 5, the quan- tum circuit involves a quantum Fourier trans- form, an inverse quantum Fourier transform, a unitary V r heat(τ) operation, and several mea- surements with M≥0. The (inverse) quantum Fourier transform can be implemented with O(n2 p) CR gates, which corresponds to O(n2 p) CNOT gates [2, 34, 35]. The complexity analysis of simulat- ing the unitary V r heat(τ) as concluded in Lemma 6 can be applied with nx = O(log(L/h)) and γ0 = a/(h2R). This results in a computational cost of O \u0010 d2T 2N 2 p log3(L/h)/(h4ε′R2) \u0011 , where ε′ represents the desired precision |Uheat(T) −V r heat(τ)| ≤ε′. The number of measurements and the er- ror of the output state can be discussed in the context of the given expressions |ˆ v(T)⟩= U(T) |ˆ v(0)⟩and |ˆ vD(T)⟩= V r heat(τ) |ˆ v(0)⟩. To retrieve |v(T)⟩and |vD(T)⟩, an inverse quantum Fourier transform can be performed on these states. After the projection with M≥0, one can observe that",

To formu- late the problem, we set L = 17, nx = 4 for the central difference approximation, and set np = 3, 5, 7, R = 4 for the Schr¨ odingerisation method. As shown in Figure 5, V (τ) is im- plemented r = T/τ times with the time incre- ment parameter τ = 0.005. The numerical results at time T = 5 are illustrated in Figure 13 and Figure 14. As shown in Figure 13, there is a clear concor- dance between the numerical solutions de- rived from the quantum circuits and those ob- tained via the classical implementation of the Schr¨ odingerisation method, regardless of the value of np. Furthermore, as the number of ancilla qubits np increases, the solutions pro- duced by the Schr¨ odingerisation method pro- gressively converge towards the solution com- puted directly using the matrix exponential operator eAt. This convergence underscores",
      "Contribution We present a detailed circuit implementation of the approximating unitary matrix V , as depicted in Figure 5. This ex- plicit implementation has not been reported in previous literature. To demonstrate the ef- fectiveness of our approach, we provide two examples: the heat equation, and the advec- tion equation with the upwind scheme which was not studied in [31]. Complexity analy- sis is performed to demonstrate the quantum advantages of these algorithms in high dimen- sions over their classical counterparts. Nu- merical experiments for both the heat equa- tion and the advection equation were per- formed using the Qiskit package [32]. The results, obtained either through statevectors or observations from the quantum circuits, closely align with those derived from classi- cal computational methods.",

Also for the parameter se- tups, where Dpx = −γT/Ωand Dpx = γΩ/6πT, we do not find any difference, even though this might be ex- pected comparing to what is found in Refs. [30, 31].

Let us mention here, that we illustrate only the first 50 out of 300 eigenvalues, which is also the number of in- cluded eigenvalues of the initially prepared system. An- other reason is as follows: even though we have the same amount of eigenvalues as discretization points from the grid, the numerical procedure we are using to extract the eigenvalues, the armadillo library [64, 65] to diagonal- ize the matrix, is more accurate for the largest eigenval- ues and less accurate for the numerically smaller values.",

      "n ξ ancillary qubits as shown in Fig. 1. We focus on the performance of codes when the encoding circuits are of low depth, that is, when ξ ≪n. Due to the light-cone constraint, each qubit can interact with only O(ξ) other qubits, limiting the spread of information across the system. Consequently, any encoding unitary from the Cε n ensemble can only achieve a code distance d on the order of O(ξ) [28]. Fortunately, by considering AQEC, the number of qubits protected against practical independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise channels can be much larger than the code distance. Here, the AQEC performance is quantified by the Choi error ϵChoi between the identity operation and D ○N ○E, where E, N, and D represent the encoding, noise, and decoding channels, respectively. This error measures the average distance between the initial and recovered states over all inputs, using an optimal decoding channel D. A detailed introduction to AQEC is provided in Section III B. Remarkably, we prove that the encoding schemes from Cε n with ξ = ω(log n) can establish a Choi error that goes to zero with an encoding rate k/n under strength-⃗ p local Pauli noise, provided that 1 −k/n −h(⃗ p) > 0. This error decay implies that these encoding schemes can achieve the well-known hashing bound of the channel capacity for local Pauli noise[29, 31, 32]. Here, ⃗ p = (pI,pX,pY ,pZ) represents the four parameters of the local Pauli noise where pI + pX + pY + pZ = 1. The entropy function is defined as h(⃗ p) = −pI log pI −pX log pX −pY log pY −pZ log pZ. When ξ = O(log n), the encoding rate can achieve a smaller one, 1 −f(⃗ p), against the same strength of Pauli noise where f(⃗ p) = 2log(√pI + √pX + √pY + √pZ). For strength-p local erasure error where each qubit is i.i.d. erased with probability p, the encoding rate can also be constant and achieve the quantum channel capacity 1 −2p [59]. The results are summarized in Result 1 and depicted in Fig. 2. We present the formal results in Corollaries 1, 2, 3 and 4.",
      "We now introduce our encoding scheme and present our main results of characterizing its AQEC performance. Our main results show the high AQEC performance of an encoding scheme realized in 1D and logarithmic-depth circuits.

The diagram of the encoding circuit is shown in Fig. 1. The n qubits are divided into 2N regions, with each region containing ξ = n/2N qubits. In the first layer, unitaries U 2i−1,2i C are applied in parallel on regions 2i −1 and 2i for 1 ≤i ≤N. In the second layer, unitaries U 2i,2i+1 C are applied in parallel on regions 2i and 2i + 1 for 1 ≤i < N. The entire encoding unitary circuit can be written as",

The encoding unitary U is a tensor product of parallel Clifford gates. Note that the depth to realize an n-qubit Clifford gate linearly depends on n. To make a fair comparison, we let the block size of the block encoding unitary be 4ξ so that the depths to realize the block encoding and the two-layer encoding are the same.

      "This result matches the upper bound in Results 1 and 2, confirming the optimality of our encoding scheme. We present the formal version of this result in Theorem 3. To prove the AQEC performance established in Results 1 and 2, we employ the complementary channel ap- proach [27], which evaluates the Choi error by characterizing how much information leaks from the system to the environment after encoding and noise. The issue becomes how decoupled the environment and the other copy of the system are after inputting an entangled state across two copies of systems, with one undergoing encoding and the com- plementary channel from system to environment. This decoupling task is illustrated in Fig. 3. To address this issue, we prove new decoupling theorems for the 1D low-depth circuit. Compared to previous decoupling results [33, 60, 61], the new decoupling theorem considers initial states and quantum channels that have a tensor-product structure. This relaxation enables the establishment of the decoupling for 1D low-depth circuits instead of high-dimensional or long- depth circuits. Meanwhile, this relaxation is sufficient for evaluating the Choi error under practical noise conditions. We present the formal theorems in Theorems 1 and 2.",

The system S undergoes an encoding unitary operation, US, followed by a channel TS→E that maps S to the environment E. The resulting output state is σER. The decoupling task examines whether σER is sufficiently close to a tensor-product state τE ⊗ρR for certain choices of US and TS→E. The role of US is to spread information within S, making it difficult for the environment E to extract information about S and R through TS→E. When E has no information about SR, it becomes decoupled from R."

      "We discuss a robust method for measuring the second R´ enyi entropy R2 x, as described by Eq. 7 of the main text. This measurement involves two steps: first, the prepara- tion of a two-copy state, and second, the measurement of the second R´ enyi entropy using quantum amplitude estimation (QAE). Here, we consider a 4-qubit case for illustration [Fig. 6]. To prepare the corresponding 2-copy ground state, consisting of 8 physical qubits, we can use the dilated operation e−βH ⊗e−βH, with each opera- tion e−βH acting on a 4-qubit chain, represented by [Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3] and [Q′ 0, Q′ 1, Q′ 2, Q′ 3]. This QITE evo- lution can be implemented by coupling the system [Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q′ 0, Q′ 1, Q′ 2, Q′ 3] to an ancilla qubit. After state preparation, a swap gate transfers the post- selection task from ancilla qubit A1 to A0 (see Fig. 6). This rearrangement ensures that QAE targets ancilla qubit A1, optimally positioned near the physical chain. Here, we use A to denote the selected subsystem, with its corresponding density matrix ρA. It can be shown that Tr(ρ2 A) = Tr(SWAPρ⊗2 A ) where the SWAP opera- tor acts as SWAP ψ1 A ψ2 A = ψ2 A ψ1 A [117]. Thus,",

      "In the previous subsection, we have experimentally inves- tigated QWEs of pure target states. Let us next turn our at- tention to QECCs. As we established in Sec. III C, the QWEs of a QECC can be directly measured via Bell sampling from ρ⊗2 QECC, where ρQECC [Eq. (1)] is the maximally mixed state within the code space. In principle, this protocol (Fig. 2) has the desirable single-setting property discussed in Sec. III A, provided one can deterministically prepare ρQECC. Alterna- tively, one could update the state preparation circuit on a shot- by-shot basis as ρ⊗2 QECC is physically indistinguishable from a uniformly at random (and independently for each copy) pre- pared logical computational basis state. Fortunately, this sec- ond protocol can be derandomized when the number of qubits is small. This is best explained for an Jn, 1, dK code with log- ical state vectors |0⟩L and |1⟩L. Assume that the logical bit- flip gate XL admits a transversal implementation, which is the case for all stabilizer codes [1] and some non-stabilizer codes [130]. Then, it suffices to perform Bell sampling from just two different input states, namely |0, 0⟩L and |0, 1⟩L. In- deed, since QWEs are invariant [53] under local unitary gates such as XL⊗XL, the TPDs arising from |1, 1⟩L and |1, 0⟩L, re- spectively, ideally coincide with those from |0, 0⟩L and |0, 1⟩L. Hence, there is no need for taking Bell samples from |1, 1⟩L and |1, 0⟩L [131]. We perform the described two-setting experiment for the seven-qubit color code [49, 132, 133] and present the mea- sured QWEs and their dual QWEs in Fig. 4. The seven-qubit color code is a J7, 1, 3K stabilizer QECC that is well explored in experiments [6, 10, 134–144]. For our purposes, it suf- fices to directly prepare logical states using a circuit with eight CNOT gates per copy [142] without resorting to sophisticated fault-tolerant preparation circuits [6, 142–146]. This time, we use a buffer zone of only two ions to separate the two seven- qubit copies on our trapped-ion quantum device. In all three QWE pictures, we can see in that—in contrast to Fig. 3—the target state ρideal QECC is not a pure state and that our experimental realization ρexp QECC is even more mixed. Indeed, for a pure state, each of the three QWE distributions would have coincided— by MacWilliams’ identity—with its respective dual. This is",
      "For our first experiment, we separate the sixteen ions into three groups with different purposes. On each end of the lin- ear trap, we devote six ions to host one copy of a quantum state ρ that is our approximate experimental realization of a pure target state Ψ on n = 6 qubits. The remaining four ions in the center of the chain serve as a buffer zone to suppress the effect of laser fields leaking from one copy to the other. We prepare six different states that exhibit various features of entanglement, and directly measure their triplet probability distribution (TPD) in the two-copy Bell sampling experiment from Fig. 2. The measured TPDs (blue and yellow) are plot- ted in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. Recall from Thm. 3 that the TPD is equal to the distribution ˜ a[ρ] of Rains’ shadow QWEs. Hence (recall Fig. 1), we can transform the measured TPDs into Shor-Laflamme QWEs a[ρ] = ˜ T −1˜ a[ρ] (pink) and into Rains’ unitary QWEs a′[ρ] = ˜ T ′−1˜ a[ρ] (green), which are plotted in the top and central panel of Fig. 3, respectively. In addition to the raw experimental data (red dots), we also present in Fig. 3 error-mitigated results (green dots) obtained from the following heuristic strategy. The goal is to effec- tively remove errors from the Bell measurement circuit, which mainly suffers from noisy CNOT gates. For our first target state, Ψ1 = |0⟩⟨0|⊗6, we can neglect preparation errors. Thus, we can use its measured QWEs to calibrate those of the other states by exploiting an insight about Shor-Laflamme aka sec- tor length distribution (SLDs): the local depolarizing noise channel acts diagonally on SLDs in the sense that all i-body sector lengths ai[ρ] are individually reduced while different- body sector lengths do not interfere with each other [Eq. (15)]. Heuristically assuming that the effective noise channel (that arises when all error channels in the Bell measurement cir- cuit are backpropagated onto the measured states) is well- approximated by an error channel with this property (diagonal",
      "FIG. 2. Quantum circuit for a Bell sampling experiment with two copies of an n-qubit state ρ. As discussed in the main text, this single-setting experiment allows us to measure the QWEs of ρ. In the special case of ρ = ρQECC [Eq. (1)], this enables access to the QWEs of any QECC under investigation. If the measurement out- comes of a qubit pair (connected via a CNOT) are both equal to 1, the qubits are effectively projected into a singlet; otherwise into a triplet. By Thm. 3, the resulting triplet probability distribution [Eq. (77)] is the same as Rains’ shadow QWEs [Eq. (37)]. From this, one can compute the other QWEs by applying appropriate transforms from Fig. 1.",
      "The four vectors in Eqs. (49)–(52) are well known under the name Bell basis. The projection-valued measure that distin- guishes them is commonly referred to as Bell measurement. In practice, Bell measurements are usually realized by applying a two-qubit CNOT gate and reading out control and target qubits in the X- and Z-basis, respectively, see Fig. 2. For our pur- poses, it suffices to differentiate triplets from singlets (without fine-graining triplets), which amounts to estimating the prob- ability ⟨Ψ−| (ρ ⊗ρ) |Ψ−⟩of projecting ρ ⊗ρ into a singlet. Indeed, inserting the expression SWAP = 1 −2 |Ψ−⟩⟨Ψ−| into Eq. (48), we can write",
      "In light of Sec. II and Thm. 3, it now becomes clear how one can measure QWEs of QECCs in experiments: first, pre- pare two copies of the maximally mixed logical state ρQECC [Eq. (1)] and perform pairwise Bell measurements as in Fig. 2 above. Then, either (i) estimate the QWEs directly from the Bell samples using the single-shot estimators from Secs. III A and III B or, equivalently, (ii) estimate the TPD ˜ a[ρQECC] and then apply the transforms from Fig. 1 to obtain estimators of a[ρQECC] = ˜ T −1˜ a[ρQECC] and a′[ρQECC] = ˜ T ′−1˜ a[ρQECC].",
      "To analyze how robust the two-copy Bell sampling pro- tocol for measuring QWEs (recall Fig. 2) is against experi- mental imperfections, we continue to develop our theory from Sec. III. The first step is to revisit the two-copy observables.",

However, in the graph state paradigm, the number of edges (here 9 and 10) is precisely equal to the number of two-qubit gates in the cor- responding preparation circuit. We can do better by leaving the graph state paradigm. Via a randomized search over low- depth Clifford circuits, see Ref. [184] for details, we discover an AME state that can be prepared with only seven two-qubit gates, see Fig. 9.

For example, the test circuit has (dt, −dt, dt, −dt, · · · , dt, −dt) time sequence while the target circuit (the original circuit of concern) has (dt, dt, dt, dt, · · · , dt, dt) at the Trotter steps. Since the test circuit applies dt and −dt alternatively in the Trotter steps, the ideal (noiseless) quantum state after the Trotter steps is the initial state, and it is already known or relatively easier to estimate the expectation value of the observable at the initial state. Hence, we have ⟨O⟩by the (ideal) initial state estimation and ⟨O⟩ by running the test circuit. Then we estimate the noise factor p. Lastly, we run the target Trotterization circuit (forwarding with dt) and obtain the noisy expectation value ⟨O⟩of the target circuit. After applying the noise factor p, we estimate the noiseless expectation value ⟨O⟩. Note that the discrepancy between the noise factors of the test circuit and the target circuit is negligible to justify the depolarizing noise mitigation method. Since the self-mitigation generates a test circuit with −dt instead of dt, the test circuit preserves the circuit structure of the target circuit. The test circuit has the reversed angle parameter by −dt instead of dt. Hence, we assume the discrepancy between the noise factors of the test circuit and the target circuit is negligible. We implemented the test circuit of the SM on the optimized second-order Trotterization (refer to figure 1).

Since Uj(⃗ 0) is the identity operation, all the intermediate operations (Uj(⃗ 0)) will vanish. In this case, due to the considerable structural mismatch between the test and target circuits, the error rate, p, measured from the test circuit does not accurately reflect that of the target circuit. Therefore, we adopt (dt, dt, dt, dt, · · · , −dt, −dt, −dt, −dt) time sequence for the test circuit.

      "The comparison between TREX+DD and TREX+PT in figure 7 shows that the contribution by DD is slight, even though the performance of DD is practically validated in several experiments [56, 57, 58, 59]. We conjecture that DD has limited impact in our implementation because the circuit (see figure 1) follows a brick-wall structure, with each brick constructed as described in equation (5). In other words, because our circuit implementation is already dense, there is little room to insert additional DD scheduling. This conjecture is also supported by the PBC case (red histograms) in figure 7. Since the PBC implementation has the brick implementation between the boundary qubits (qubit 0 and 19) in the odd layers, the PBC has less room for the DD scheduling. Hence, the difference between TREX+PT and TREX+DD+PT is negligible. In other words, DD scheduling is unnecessary for the PBC case due to the lack of available space for its",

Accordingly, we compute the time evolution of the expectation value of the staggered magnetization for the N´ eel state under the given Hamiltonian using IBM’s superconducting quantum computers, and validate the results against state-of-the-art classical numerical simulations. As a first step, we compare the first-order Trotterization and the second-order Trotterization in figure 4. A p-th order Trotterization has O(t(δt)p) error where t and r are the time and the Trotter steps, respectively, and δt = t/r [55]. Hence, a fixed time and the Trotter number at the time, a higher order Trotterization has a smaller Trotterization error when δt < 1. Figure 4 compares the first-order and the second- order Trotterizations with δt = 0.5 with open boundary condition (OBC) and periodic boundary condition (PBC). The second-order Trotterization shows a good agreement with the direct method, while the first-order Trotterization shows notable disagreement with the direct method in both boundary conditions after time 1.0. The results show that the second-order Trotterization with δt = 0.5 is good enough for the observable measurement. Therefore, we adopt the optimized second-order Trotterization [14] with δt = 0.5 and 100, 000 shots in the following experiments on quantum computers. Also, we compare the MPS-TDVP with the direct method to validate its accuracy. As shown in figure 4, MPS-TDVP also shows a good agreement with the direct method in both boundary conditions. Hence, the MPS-TDVP is used as the benchmark for N = 84 (PBC) and 104 (OBC) cases.",

For the ZNE, we apply the same extrapolation fitting curve used in the N = 20 cases. As a benchmark for the true value, we use the MPS-TDVP method, as outlined earlier in this section since the direct simulation is not feasible for systems of these sizes. The accuracy of the MPS-TDVP is validated in figure 4. These simulations use more than 3, 200 and 2, 600 two-qubit gates on the OBC and the PBC, respectively, as listed in table A2.

The average absolute error value with ZNE is 0.04917 and 0.05044 on OBC and PBC, respectively, whereas the SM has 0.02556 and 0.02832 on OBC and PBC, respectively. The SM achieves an average absolute error reduction of 48.0% on OBC and 43.9% on PBC compared to ZNE. Furthermore, the average absolute errors of ZNE increase by 19.8% and 22.3% compared to the 20-qubit cases for OBC and PBC, respectively. In conclusion, the SM yields the lowest mean absolute error across all tested system sizes and boundary conditions, clearly outperforming both ZNE and the baseline (TREX+DD+PT) among the three methods. When comparing the 20-qubit systems with the larger systems (104 and 84 qubits), the SM method maintains similar absolute errors, whereas the ZNE method exhibits increased absolute errors in the larger systems. This likely stems from the fact that the ZNE extrapolation curve, derived from the 20- qubit systems, does not accurately capture the error characteristics of the larger systems. In contrast, the SM method more effectively estimates the noise factors in both small and large-scale systems since SM leverages the circuit’s inherent noise characteristics and preserves robustness without increasing circuit depth. These features make SM a promising approach for scalable and reliable quantum simulations of Trotterization on near-term noisy quantum devices. However, the SM technique is particularly effective when the true observable can be readily estimated, such as in Trotterization, while ZNE can be applied to more general cases.",

      "phase measurement is perfect. These mechanisms are intu- itively reﬂected in the variation of QEC performance and KL cost function for NP codes with ¯ ncode, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and in supplementary Figure 2, respectively. On the other hand, a technology proposed by our previous work [66] can serve as an alternative phase measurement for speciﬁc NP codes with θn = ïn|α,rð. The noisy NP codes with such a Fock-amplitude θn behave as a mixture of rotated coherent-like states due to the NP vortex effect, following the interface gate operation, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Coincidentally, this technology has achieved the unambiguous discrimination of up to six coherent states (|α| f 2) uniformly distributed on a phase circle, corresponding to the required phase mea- surement for NP codes with dN = 3. It is a potential way to unambiguously identify error subspaces formed by rotated coherent-like states with a low excitation, and the measure- ment time is around log2(2dN) µs. Additionally, a key step in implementing generalized NP codes is the state preparation of logical states |+ðL(s,0) for R-NP codes. It is not a trivial task to prepare such a state with a large Fock space interval s. In circuit QED, a universal method for preparing an arbitrary state of a target cavity mode is available in principle. It involves the strong dispersive in- teraction between the cavity mode and an ancilla transmon, combined with quadrature displacement operations performed on the cavity mode [67–70]. In experiments, this method per- forms well for preparing high-ﬁdelity logical states with sev- eral photons in ∼1 µs [23, 25]. However, preparing logical states with good phase distinguishability for high-order R-NP codes remains challenging via this method, as such states typ- ically contain tens of photons. This arises because the process involves long operation times and complex controls, where the photon decay of the short-lifetime ancilla transmon introduces more noise, leading to errors in the state preparation. The transformation from the R-NP codes (s,0) to general- ized NP codes (s, f) is based on the interface gate, as shown in Eq. (9), which is also frequently used in teleportation- based QEC. Its implementation requires controlled self-Kerr interaction H = K ˆ n/2 for the data mode. This technology has been achieved in a Kerr-tunable superconducting res- onator [71], where the self-Kerr interaction strength K/2π can be adjusted from −5 MHz to 6 MHz, and the special log- ical state |+ðL(1, f) = ˆ Uf |αð of the O-NP code (with f = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and ¯ ncode = 2) is prepared within a gate time of ∼0.1µs. However, this experimental work was conducted in the strong dissipation regime (γ/Kmax ≈0.1). Therefore, the realization of interface gates still requires the extension of the data mode lifetime to ensure that noise caused by photon loss during operations is negligible (γ/Kmax j 1). In a recent experiment [72], a comparable superconducting resonator de- vice achieved a lifetime of T1 ∼40 µs, presenting a promising platform to implement the feasible interface gate with an esti- mated γ/Kmax ratio of ∼2.5×10−3. In Fig. 3, we present a QEC scheme only using bosonic modes, which is expected to perform QEC under bosonic- level noise and is promising for realizing fault-tolerant quan- tum computation based on bosonic modes. However, such a scheme requires entangling gates implemented by cross-Kerr",
      "∝exp(−2α2). This is based on the commutation relations be- tween quadrature displacement operators, and the similar gate protocol for two-leg cat codes is proposed in Ref. [28]. In ad- dition, the logical Pauli Z operation can be easily realized by a phase rotation ˆ R(π/s) for all generalized NP codes (s, f). Based on above features of O-NP codes, they can be eas- ily implemented in optical systems. The interface gate may be realized by propagating a light ﬁeld in a Kerr nonlin- earity medium, and the generation of optical cat states have been widely studied in experiments [76–80]. Moreover, the most challenging aspect of realizing the one-step-teleportation QEC scheme [Eq. (12)] for O-NP codes is the correct identi- ﬁcation of rotated codewords following the interface gate op- eration, analogous to the scenario depicted in Fig. 3(c). In essence, this task constitutes a phase estimation problem for rotated coherent states, and the required phase measurement is also fast-growing in experiments [47, 66, 81, 82]. Conse- quently, large-sized O-NP encoding of an optical mode is very suitable for executing long-distance quantum communication and interconnection. On the other hand, the R-NP codes with non-trivial rota- tion symmetry , such as the cat codes and binomial codes, may suitably implement fault-tolerant quantum computation by encoding the microwave ﬁeld stored in a superconducting cavity. The code state preparation and universal control for these codes can be achieved by manipulating the microwave cavity with a coupled discrete-variable ancillae. This allows for the strict identiﬁcation of error syndromes in these codes, followed by the restoration of quantum information. The rele- vant experimental demonstration and theoretical proposal had a ﬂourishing development in past decades. Moreover, the QEC performance of R-NP codes may be further improved by performing an additional unitary ˆ Uf=1/2 on the code states, namely, encoding to be the D-NP codes. The truth that the D-NP codes have higher performance than R-NP and O-NP codes is analogous to which the hexagonal GKP codes have higher performance than square GKP codes. Based on the relative advantages of generalized NP codes in experiments, the faithful quantum computer and the long-distance quantum communication in a quantum network may be achieved using hybrid generalized NP encoding of bosonic modes. In summary, we construct a novel framework of bosonic en- coding, which deﬁnes the logical states via discrete number- phase translation symmetry. It is designed to against the number-phase shift error of a bosonic mode, which involves the energy decay and the quantum dephasing. The framework contains many well-known bosonic codes, such as cat codes and binomial codes, and it also guides us to ﬁnd the O-NP codes and D-NP codes, which can be imagined as number- phase vortex in NP space. Crucially, such a number-phase vortex effect is an independent quantum resource, which paves a new way to correct the number-shift errors using phase degrees. Moreover, the O-NP codes are easily generated and implemented QEC for optical modes, which may allow it to suitably implement long-distance quantum communication in a hybrid quantum network or any application scenarios re- quired to resist the NP-shifts noise in a bosonic mode. We believe that the framework can inspire the experiments and",
      "Lastly, due to the photon loss of the ancilla transmon, the required operations for bosonic modes may be faulty. Therefore, we simulate the noisy QEC cycle shown in Fig. 3 with experimental limitations. It demonstrates that the trans- mon dissipation during the gate operations introduces uncor- rectable logical errors, thereby limiting the QEC performance of generalized NP codes. However, the main physical mech- anism (number-phase vortex effect) of these codes is not sig- niﬁcantly affected by imperfect gate operations. The detailed simulation results can be found in the supplementary Note 7. In a short-term consideration, the photon loss of an an- cilla transmon can already be suppressed to the second order by replacing the employed excited state |eð with a higher ex- cited state |fð of a three-level transmon [73]. Furthermore, the fundamental solution for these operational imperfections would require the development of fault-tolerant operations for these codes, which is a challenging but crucial long-term ob- jective. Nonetheless, there are several theoretical frameworks that can be extended to achieve fault-tolerance for generalized NP codes [31, 74, 75]. The QEC of a generalized NP code is based on the one-step teleportation, as shown in Eq. (12). Notably, the teleportation between two physical qubits can be extended to achieve fault- tolerance for biased noise by encoding the physical qubits into repetition codes, as proposed in Ref. [74]. For generalized NP codes, after partial number-shift errors are strictly iden- tiﬁed by the non-destructive number-parity measurement, the remaining errors are all phase rotation errors that are similar to biased noise. Therefore, a natural ideal is to extend the teleportation between two individual generalized NP codes to fault-tolerant teleportation between two repetition codes en- coded by condensed generalized NP codes. For R-NP codes, this method for achieving fault-tolerance has been compre- hensively discussed in Ref. [31]. Another promising scheme for implementing fault-tolerant operations on single-mode bosonic codes with discrete- variable ancillae is based on the path-independent quantum control [75]. Compared with the previous scheme dedicated to NP codes, this scheme has stronger universality and lower resource consumption, maintaining the hardware efﬁciency of single-mode bosonic quantum codes.",
      "without affecting the Pauli Z operator ˆ D(nz) that depends the rotation symmetry of the codespaces. As we showed in the main text, the interface gate can be used to change the code distance dN of the generalized NP codes. For example, we graphically illustrate the transformation of codewords |+ðL between the R-NP code [s = 1, f = 0,r = 0] and the O-NP code [Supplementary Figure 1(b)] , with a shared mean code excitation ¯ ncode = 6, as shown in Supplementary Figure 3(a) and (b). Here the code distance dN = 1 of the R-NP code is unitarily transformed to be dN = 4 for the O-NP code through the interface gate ˆ Uf=1/4, while the code distance dφ = π remains unchanged. Another main use of such a gate is to interface the generalized NP codes (s, f) and the R-NP codes (s,0) with the shared parameter s. Due to the qubit operations Ps for R-NP codes have been widely studied in experiments, the interface gates allow these operations to be compatible with the generalized NP codes as Ps, f = ˆ Us( f)Ps ˆ U† s (f). This can be understood as a two-step process: ﬁrst, transferring a generalized NP code (s, f) to R-NP code (s,0) to execute qubit operations, and then transferring it back to the original code spaces to complete the qubit operations for the generalized NP code (s, f). Given that any phase rotation commutes with interface gates, a critical application of these gates is to map a noisy generalized NP code onto the R-NP structure. This process enables the discrete phase rotation—induced by the NP vortex effect—to be readout using canonical phase measurements. The graphical representation of this process is shown in Supplementary Figure 3, where we demonstrate the discrete phase rotation caused by single-photon loss. Before using the interface gate ˆ U† f , the phase rotation of generalized NP codes [Supplementary Figure 3(c)] can not be directly readout by the canonical phase measurement. This is because the codeword is only localized in the direction orthogonal to nx, rendering its canonical phase distribution non-local. After performing the interface gate ˆ U† f [Supplementary Figure 3(d)], nx becomes orthogonal to the canonical phase, localizing the codeword’s distribution in the canonical phase. Consequently, the phase rotation (∆φ = π/4) can be accurately readout by the canonical phase measurement.",
      "One-way quantum communication The generalized NP codes, especially the well-known R-NP codes, have been ex- perimentally demonstrated to have many applications. For ex- ample, the cat codes with QEC can extend the lifetime of a qubit [23], and the binomial codes with QEC can protect the entanglement between two qubits [26]. The generalized NP codes with repetitive QEC are also promising to execute long-distance quantum communication based on the quantum repeaters (QRs) [32–35, 37–39]. One round QEC should correct the transmission loss 1−e−˜ L0 and the the ﬁber coupling loss ε, where ˜ L0 = L/Latt is the di- mensionless repeater spacing, and Latt = 20 km for optical ﬁber [57]. In addition, the energy attenuation in nonlinear op- tical ﬁbers with Kerr medium can lead to pure phase rotation errors of the quantum states, which are usually ignored by pre- vious studies [36, 57]. In the QEC process shown in Fig. 3, the imperfect quantum gates and measurements also result in de- phasing errors [58, 59]. Given that the commutation of all de- phasing errors with both the interface gate and the controlled- phase gate, these errors can be theoretically treated as occur- ring before the ideal QEC process. Therefore, the excitation- loss and dephasing errors can be collectively modeled by the Eq. (16), and the excitation-loss rate of one instance QEC is",
      "The left side of Eq. (17) is actually the ﬁrst-order Kraus oper- ator of pure-loss channel (i.e., Eq. (16) with κ = 0) [36, 49]. Note that the modulus of the superposition coefﬁcient on the right side of Eq. (17) is related to a Lorentzian function with a linewidth γt. If the square root term √γt is retained while the higher-order term γt is ignored, an unphysical representation of single-photon loss can be obtained, where the expansion coefﬁcient diverges when φ = 0. The error rates must satisfy γt,κt j 1 to guarantee sufﬁciently small NP displacements of the codewords, thereby ensuring effective QEC. Additionally, the analogous representation for the single-photon gain oper- ator can be straightforwardly obtained as the complex conju- gation of the single-photon loss. The noisy code states then need to be sent to the QEC cir- cuit to remove the noise and recover the logical information. As an example, we illustrate the QEC of a noisy D-NP code to demonstrate how the error correction works, as shown in Fig. 3. After the recovery process, the QEC performance of the generalized NP codes can be qualiﬁed by the channel ﬁ- delity [54]",

Here, we choose the logical state |+ðL of a D-NP code [s = 2; f = 1/2; r = −0.1; ¯ ncode = 9] as an example. The noisy state N ( ˆ ρ) [(a)] has an overlap ∼0.37 with the ideal logical state, which is obtained by the evolution in the error model Eq.

The Wigner function (c) is obtained after performing the interface gates ˆ U† f , which is back to the R-NP structure, and the shallower peaks are present due to the NP vortex effect. The state (d), corrected via a perfect QEC cycle, has an overlap ∼0.97 with the ideal logical state. (e) and (f) are the circuit representations of the modular number-parity measurement and the teleportation-based QEC, deﬁned in Eqs. (12) and (14), respectively. The double lines indicate the transmission of classical measurement outcomes for the recovery feedback.",
      "In Fig. 3 of the main text, we propose using cross-Kerr interaction between the data mode and an ancilla bosonic mode to implement the entangling gate. Such a method is expected to manipulate the NP codes with errors in bosonic level. However, the cross-Kerr interaction strength between two cavities is not large enough compared to the cavity decay rate in the current experiments. Therefore, it represents a long-term goal for the QEC, which only involves bosonic modes. For the current experimental consideration, the readout of the number-parity for the NP code can be easily achieved us- ing the traditional dispersively coupled transmon, which is widely employed in bosonic QEC experiments. Furthermore, the teleportation-based QEC between two cavity modes can also be indirectly achieved with an ancilla transmon, as shown in the Eq. (26) of the main text. Based on these considerations, the time-dependent QEC circuit proposed in the main text can be represented in Supplementary Figure 6. Different from the ideal QEC scenario, the noise from gate operations of ﬁnite duration will introduce additional errors.",

      "phase measurement is perfect. These mechanisms are intu- itively reﬂected in the variation of QEC performance and KL cost function for NP codes with ¯ ncode, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and in supplementary Figure 2, respectively. On the other hand, a technology proposed by our previous work [66] can serve as an alternative phase measurement for speciﬁc NP codes with θn = ïn|α,rð. The noisy NP codes with such a Fock-amplitude θn behave as a mixture of rotated coherent-like states due to the NP vortex effect, following the interface gate operation, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Coincidentally, this technology has achieved the unambiguous discrimination of up to six coherent states (|α| f 2) uniformly distributed on a phase circle, corresponding to the required phase mea- surement for NP codes with dN = 3. It is a potential way to unambiguously identify error subspaces formed by rotated coherent-like states with a low excitation, and the measure- ment time is around log2(2dN) µs. Additionally, a key step in implementing generalized NP codes is the state preparation of logical states |+ðL(s,0) for R-NP codes. It is not a trivial task to prepare such a state with a large Fock space interval s. In circuit QED, a universal method for preparing an arbitrary state of a target cavity mode is available in principle. It involves the strong dispersive in- teraction between the cavity mode and an ancilla transmon, combined with quadrature displacement operations performed on the cavity mode [67–70]. In experiments, this method per- forms well for preparing high-ﬁdelity logical states with sev- eral photons in ∼1 µs [23, 25]. However, preparing logical states with good phase distinguishability for high-order R-NP codes remains challenging via this method, as such states typ- ically contain tens of photons. This arises because the process involves long operation times and complex controls, where the photon decay of the short-lifetime ancilla transmon introduces more noise, leading to errors in the state preparation. The transformation from the R-NP codes (s,0) to general- ized NP codes (s, f) is based on the interface gate, as shown in Eq. (9), which is also frequently used in teleportation- based QEC. Its implementation requires controlled self-Kerr interaction H = K ˆ n/2 for the data mode. This technology has been achieved in a Kerr-tunable superconducting res- onator [71], where the self-Kerr interaction strength K/2π can be adjusted from −5 MHz to 6 MHz, and the special log- ical state |+ðL(1, f) = ˆ Uf |αð of the O-NP code (with f = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and ¯ ncode = 2) is prepared within a gate time of ∼0.1µs. However, this experimental work was conducted in the strong dissipation regime (γ/Kmax ≈0.1). Therefore, the realization of interface gates still requires the extension of the data mode lifetime to ensure that noise caused by photon loss during operations is negligible (γ/Kmax j 1). In a recent experiment [72], a comparable superconducting resonator de- vice achieved a lifetime of T1 ∼40 µs, presenting a promising platform to implement the feasible interface gate with an esti- mated γ/Kmax ratio of ∼2.5×10−3. In Fig. 3, we present a QEC scheme only using bosonic modes, which is expected to perform QEC under bosonic- level noise and is promising for realizing fault-tolerant quan- tum computation based on bosonic modes. However, such a scheme requires entangling gates implemented by cross-Kerr",
      "where ˆ Nj is the Kraus operator of the noise channel N , and the Kraus-operator decomposition of the noise channel N is given in the supplementary Note 4. In principle, the generalized NP codes with the same code distance dN = sq should perform similarly when the phase un- certainty is small enough. It indicates the mean excitation of codes ¯ ncode is large, and thus the bit-ﬂip error is domi- nant. However, the performance of NP codes will become different when the phase-ﬂip error is non-negligible with the small ¯ ncode. This performance difference comes from both the different NP lattice structures and the Fock-amplitude series {θn}. To compare the performance of NP codes with different NP lattice structures, we numerically evaluate the QEC chan- nel inﬁdelity as a function of the mean code excitation ¯ ncode, shown in Fig. 4 (a). As an example, here we focus on the binomial code, the O-NP code, and the D-NP code, whose Fock amplitudes are both selected as |θnð = ïn|α,rð. Among cat and binomial codes, we selected binomial codes as the representative R-NP codes because previous research data in Refs. [31, 49] indicate that binomial codes exhibit better QEC performance than cat codes under the same conditions. These NP codes have the same code distance dN = 4, and the squeezed parameter r of the O-NP and D-NP codes is opti- mized to minimize the channel inﬁdelity. The numerical re- sults show that the binomial codes and the O-NP codes have a similar performance, while the D-NP code has an outstanding performance when the mean code excitation ¯ ncode is small. This phenomenon indicates that correcting number-shift er- rors using only the number degree (R-NP codes) or the phase degree (O-NP codes) has similar QEC performance; however, correcting number-shift errors using a hybrid number-phase degree can enhance QEC performance. As expected, the three types of NP codes have similar per- formance when ¯ ncode is large enough, as shown in Fig. 4(a). In",
      "We quantify the QR performance of three types of NP codes by considering the quantum key distribution. In Fig. 4 (b), we compare the optimized secure key rate per mode (SKRPM) of three NP codes, where the ﬁber coupling loss ε = 1%, and the dephasing error rate is selected as Γφ = 0.1Γ. The three types of NP codes yield an SKRPM > 0.01 for a near-thousand- kilometer quantum communication. As expected, the bino- mial codes and the O-NP codes have similar performance for quantum communication, while the D-NP codes have an out- standing performance. The slight advantage of O-NP codes over binomial codes arises from their superior tolerance to pure rotation errors when the code distance dφ = π/s of the binomial code is small enough. Moreover, we also simulate their QRs performance with Γφ = 0.05Γ, where the commu- nication distance is signiﬁcantly extended as the dephasing error rate Γφ is further suppressed, and the behavior of per- formance remains unchanged. The detailed numerical results",
      "Different from the well-known R-NP codes that uses error subspaces with different number parity to avoid number-shift errors, the generalized NP codes suggest that the rotated codespaces also serves as error subspaces for the number shift errors based on the practical number-phase vortex structure. Here, we consider the O-NP and the D-NP code as examples to demonstrate the error subspaces distribution in the continuous-variable phase space after performing the interface gate ˆ U† f , as shown in Supplementary Figure 4. These rotated codewords can be distinguished by the phase measurement mentioned in the above section, and the measurement outcomes give error syndromes. In the main text, we proposed the recovery circuit of the noisy O-NP codes based on an one-step teleportation. The main mechanism is the controlled phase gate induced bell entanglement between the data mode and the ancilla mode.",

Furthermore, we illustrate that the QEC processes of O- NP codes with the code states passed through the noise channel N (ρ) by using NP phase space representation, shown in Supplementary Figure 5. Here, the O-NP code allows the number-shift errors to be equivalent to phase rotation errors, and the phase probability distribution of the noisy O-NP code after performing the interface gate ˆ U† f is shown in the Supplementary Figure 5 (b2). Based on the NP vortex effect, the peaks of the phase probability distribution represents the number-shifts induced phase rotation, and the higher-order number-shift will result in a lower peak due to the less probability of occurrence. Therefore, one can perform the feedback operation on the teleported ancilla mode according to the outcome X of the canonical phase measurement. Different from the number-parity, the rotated codewords are not exactly orthogonal due to the non-vanished phase uncertainty. The key problem is how to manage the intervals of the measurement outcomes, thereby correctly implementing the recovery operations for achieving the maximal channel ﬁdelity. This problem is difﬁcult to solve analytically, but it can be easily solved by a simple numerical optimization.

For an outcome X of the phase measurement, the classical computer can give a best recovery operation among the four situations which gives the maximal ﬁdelity. Therefore, every outcome X corresponds to a best recovery operation, thus we can manage the intervals of the outcomes according to the priori best recovery operation given by the classical computer.
